<div style="position:absolute;top:3157;left:108"><nobr>Neither you nor I speak English, but there are some things that can be said only in English.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3199;left:108"><nobr>My ex-employer the late Mr. Ashok's ex-wife, Pinky Madam, taught me one of these things; and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3220;left:108"><nobr>at 11:32 p.m. today, which was about ten minutes ago, when the lady on All India Radio</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3240;left:108"><nobr>announced, &quot;Premier Jiabao is coming to Bangalore next week,&quot; I said that thing at once.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3282;left:108"><nobr>In fact, each time when great men like you visit our country I say it. Not that I have anything</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3302;left:108"><nobr>against great men. In my way, sir, I consider myself one of your kind. But whenever I see our</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3323;left:108"><nobr>prime minister and his distinguished sidekicks drive to the airport in black cars and get out and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3344;left:108"><nobr>do <i>namastes </i>before you in front of a TV camera and tell you about how moral and saintly India</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3364;left:108"><nobr>is, I have to say that thing in English.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3406;left:108"><nobr>Now, you <i>are </i>visiting us this week, Your Excellency, aren't you? All India Radio is usually</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3427;left:108"><nobr>reliable in these matters.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3468;left:108"><nobr>That was a joke, sir.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3510;left:108"><nobr>Ha!</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3551;left:108"><nobr>That's why I want to ask you directly if you really are coming to Bangalore. Because if you are, I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3571;left:108"><nobr>have something important to tell you. See, the lady on the radio said, &quot;Mr. Jiabao is on a mission:</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3592;left:108"><nobr>he wants to know the truth about Bangalore.&quot; </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:3851;left:108"><nobr>My blood froze. If anyone knows the truth about Bangalore, it's <i>me.</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3892;left:108"><nobr>Next, the lady announcer said, &quot;Mr. Jiabao wants to meet some Indian entrepreneurs and hear the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3913;left:108"><nobr>story of their success from their own lips.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3954;left:108"><nobr>She explained a little. Apparently, sir, you Chinese are far ahead of us in every respect, except</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3975;left:108"><nobr>that you don't have entrepreneurs. And our nation, though it has no drinking water, electricity,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:3996;left:108"><nobr>sewage system, public transportation, sense of hygiene, discipline, courtesy, or punctuality, <i>does</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4017;left:108"><nobr>have entrepreneurs. Thousands and thousands of them. Especially in the field of technology. And</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4037;left:108"><nobr>these entrepreneurs—<i>we </i>entrepreneurs—have set up all these outsourcing companies that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4058;left:108"><nobr>virtually run America now.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4099;left:108"><nobr>You hope to learn how to make a few Chinese entrepreneurs, that's why you're visiting. That</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4120;left:108"><nobr>made me feel good. But then it hit me that in keeping with international protocol, the prime</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4141;left:108"><nobr>minister and foreign minister of my country will meet you at the airport with garlands, small</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4161;left:108"><nobr>take-home sandalwood statues of Gandhi, and a booklet full of information about India's past,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4182;left:108"><nobr>present, and future.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4224;left:108"><nobr>That's when I <i>had </i>to say that thing in English, sir. Out loud.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4265;left:108"><nobr>That was at 11:37 p.m. Five minutes ago.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4306;left:108"><nobr>I don't just swear and curse. I'm a man of action and change. I decided right there and then to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4327;left:108"><nobr>start dictating a letter to you.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4368;left:108"><nobr>To begin with, let me tell you of my great admiration for the ancient nation of China.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4410;left:108"><nobr>I read about your history in a book, <i>Exciting Tales of the Exotic East, </i>that I found on the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4431;left:108"><nobr>pavement, back in the days when I was trying to get some enlightenment by going through the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4451;left:108"><nobr>Sunday secondhand book market in Old Delhi. This book was mostly about pirates and gold in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4472;left:108"><nobr>Hong Kong, but it did have some useful background information too: it said that you Chinese are</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4493;left:108"><nobr>great lovers of freedom and individual liberty. The British tried to make you their servants, but</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4514;left:108"><nobr>you never let them do it. I admire that, Mr. Premier.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4555;left:108"><nobr>I was a servant once, you see.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4596;left:108"><nobr>Only three nations have never let themselves be ruled by foreigners: China, Afghanistan, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4617;left:108"><nobr>Abyssinia. These are the only three nations I admire.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4658;left:108"><nobr>Out of respect for the love of liberty shown by the Chinese people, and also in the belief that the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4679;left:108"><nobr>future of the world lies with the yellow man and the brown man now that our erstwhile master,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:4700;left:108"><nobr>the white-skinned man, has wasted himself through buggery, cell phone usage, and drug abuse, I</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:5329;left:108"><nobr>In terms of formal education, I may be somewhat lacking. I never finished school, to put it</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:5391;left:108"><nobr>fellow whose name I forget. I am a self-taught entrepreneur.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5432;left:108"><nobr>That's the best kind there is, trust me.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:5494;left:108"><nobr>(though probably least known) businessmen, you will know everything there is to know about</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5515;left:108"><nobr>how entrepreneurship is born, nurtured, and developed in this, the glorious twenty-first century</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5536;left:108"><nobr>of man.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:5660;left:108"><nobr>It is a little before midnight now, Mr. Jiabao. A good time for me to talk.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5702;left:108"><nobr>I stay up the whole night, Your Excellency. And there's no one else in this 150-square-foot office</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5722;left:108"><nobr>of mine. Just me and a chandelier above me, although the chandelier has a personality of its own.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5743;left:108"><nobr>It's a huge thing, full of small diamond-shaped glass pieces, just like the ones they used to show</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5763;left:108"><nobr>in the films of the 1970s. Though it's cool enough at night in Bangalore, I've put a midget fan—</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5784;left:108"><nobr>five cobwebby blades—right above the chandelier. See, when it turns, the small blades chop up</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5805;left:108"><nobr>the chandelier's light and fling it across the room. Just like the strobe light at the best discos in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5826;left:108"><nobr>Bangalore.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5867;left:108"><nobr>This is the only 150-square-foot space in Bangalore with its own chandelier! But it's still a hole</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5888;left:108"><nobr>in the wall, and I sit here the whole night.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5929;left:108"><nobr>The entrepreneur's curse. He has to watch his business all the time.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:5971;left:108"><nobr>Now I'm going to turn the midget fan on, so that the chandelier's light spins around the room. </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:6908;left:108"><nobr>Now, there are some, and I don't just mean Communists like you, but thinking men of all</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6928;left:108"><nobr>political parties, who think that not many of these gods actually exist. Some believe that <i>none </i>of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6949;left:108"><nobr>them exist. There's just us and an ocean of darkness around us. I'm no philosopher or poet, how</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6970;left:108"><nobr>would I know the truth? It's true that all these gods seem to do awfully little work—much like</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:6991;left:108"><nobr>our politicians—and yet keep winning reelection to their golden thrones in heaven, year after</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7011;left:108"><nobr>year. That's not to say that I don't respect them, Mr. Premier! Don't you ever let that blasphemous</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7032;left:108"><nobr>idea into your yellow skull. My country is the kind where it pays to play it both ways: the Indian</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7053;left:108"><nobr>entrepreneur has to be straight and crooked, mocking and believing, sly and sincere, at the same</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7074;left:108"><nobr>time.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7115;left:108"><nobr>So: I'm closing my eyes, folding my hands in a reverent <i>namaste, </i>and praying to the gods to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7135;left:108"><nobr>shine light on my dark story.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:7177;left:108"><nobr>Bear with me, Mr. Jiabao. This could take a while. </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:8241;left:108"><nobr>&quot;The thing is, he probably has…what, two, three years of schooling in him? He can read and</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:12498;left:108"><nobr>bore the corpse; my uncles, who are Munnu, Jayram, Divyram, and Umesh, stood behind,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12519;left:108"><nobr>holding up the other end. My mother's body had been wrapped from head to toe in a saffron silk</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12540;left:108"><nobr>cloth, which was covered in rose petals and jasmine garlands. I don't think she had ever had such</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12560;left:108"><nobr>a fine thing to wear in her life. (Her death was so grand that I knew, all at once, that her life must</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12581;left:108"><nobr>have been miserable. My family was guilty about something.) My aunts—Rabri, Shalini, Malini,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12602;left:108"><nobr>Luttu, Jaydevi, and Ruchi—kept turning around and clapping their hands for me to catch up to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12622;left:108"><nobr>them. I remember swinging my hands and singing, &quot;Shiva's name is the truth!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12664;left:108"><nobr>We walked past temple after temple, praying to god after god, and then went in a single file</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12684;left:108"><nobr>between a red temple devoted to Hanuman and an open gymnasium where three body builders</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12705;left:108"><nobr>heaved rusted weights over their heads. I smelled the river before I saw it: a stench of decaying</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12722;left:108"><nobr>flesh rising from my right. I sang louder: &quot;…the only truth!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12767;left:108"><nobr>Then there was a gigantic noise: firewood being split. A wooden platform had been built by the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12788;left:108"><nobr>edge of the <i>ghat, </i>just above the water; logs were piled up on the platform, and men with axes</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12809;left:108"><nobr>were smashing the logs. Chunks of wood were being built into funeral pyres on the steps of the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12830;left:108"><nobr><i>ghat </i>that went down into the water; four bodies were burning on the <i>ghat </i>steps when we got</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12850;left:108"><nobr>there. We waited our turn.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12891;left:108"><nobr>In the distance, an island of white sand glistened in the sunlight, and boats full of people were</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12912;left:108"><nobr>heading to that island. I wondered if my mother's soul had flown there, to that shining place in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12933;left:108"><nobr>the river.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12974;left:108"><nobr>I have mentioned that my mother's body was wrapped in a silk cloth. This cloth was now pulled</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:12995;left:108"><nobr>over her face; and logs of wood, as many as we could pay for, were piled on top of the body.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13016;left:108"><nobr>Then the priest set my mother on fire.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13057;left:108"><nobr>&quot;She was a good, quiet girl the day she came to our home,&quot; Kusum said, as she put a hand on my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13078;left:108"><nobr>face. &quot;I was not the one who wanted any fighting.&quot; </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:13438;left:108"><nobr>shoved the foot into the fire, but it would not burn. My heart began to race. My mother wasn't</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:13500;left:108"><nobr>Underneath the platform with the piled-up fire logs, there was a giant oozing mound of black</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13521;left:108"><nobr>mud where the river washed into the shore. The mound was littered with ribbons of jasmine, rose</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:13645;left:108"><nobr>This mud was holding her back: this big, swelling mound of black ooze. She was trying to fight</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:13686;left:108"><nobr>in. It was so thick, and more of it was being created every moment as the river washed into the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13707;left:108"><nobr><i>ghat. </i>Soon she would become part of the black mound and the pale-skinned dog would start</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13728;left:108"><nobr>licking her.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13769;left:108"><nobr>And then I understood: this was the real god of Benaras—this black mud of the Ganga into</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:13810;left:108"><nobr>would happen to me when I died and they brought me here. Nothing would get liberated here.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:13852;left:108"><nobr>I stopped breathing.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:14038;left:108"><nobr>Mr. Jiabao. Surely you've heard of Bodh Gaya—the town where the Lord Buddha sat under a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14059;left:108"><nobr>tree and found his enlightenment and started Buddhism, which then spread to the whole world,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14079;left:108"><nobr>including China—and where is it, but right here in my home district! Just a few miles from</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14100;left:108"><nobr>Laxmangarh!</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14142;left:108"><nobr>I wonder if the Buddha walked through Laxmangarh—some people say he did. My own feeling</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14162;left:108"><nobr>is that he ran through it—as fast as he could—and got to the other side—and never looked back!</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14204;left:108"><nobr>There is a small branch of the Ganga that flows just outside Laxmangarh; boats come down from</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14225;left:108"><nobr>the world outside, bringing supplies every Monday. There is one street in the village; a bright</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:14245;left:108"><nobr>strip of sewage splits it into two. On either side of the ooze, a market: three more or less identical</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:15413;left:108"><nobr>of it, and there might be a little more money at the end of the day. She was a fat, glossy-skinned</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:17540;left:108"><nobr>The rickshaw-pullers parked their vehicles in a line outside the tea shop, waiting for the bus to</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:17602;left:108"><nobr>They were not allowed to sit on the plastic chairs put out for the customers; they had to crouch</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17623;left:108"><nobr>near the back, in that hunched-over, squatting posture common to servants in every part of India.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17643;left:108"><nobr>My father never crouched—I remember that. He preferred to stand, no matter how long he had to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17664;left:108"><nobr>wait and how uncomfortable it got for him. I would find him shirtless, usually alone, drinking tea</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17685;left:108"><nobr>and thinking.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17726;left:108"><nobr>Then there would be the honk of a car.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17768;left:108"><nobr>The hogs and stray dogs near the tea shop would scatter, and the smell of dust, and sand, and hog</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17789;left:108"><nobr>shit would blow into the shop. A white Ambassador car had stopped outside. My father put down</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17809;left:108"><nobr>his teacup and went out.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:17851;left:108"><nobr>The door of the Ambassador opened: a man got out with a notebook. The regular customers of </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:18107;left:108"><nobr>the tea shop could go on eating, but my father and the others gathered in a line.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18148;left:108"><nobr>The man with the notebook was not the Buffalo; he was the assistant.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18190;left:108"><nobr>There was another fellow inside the Ambassador; a stout one with a bald, brown, dimpled head,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18210;left:108"><nobr>a serene expression on his face, and a shotgun on his lap.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18252;left:108"><nobr><i>He </i>was the Buffalo.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18293;left:108"><nobr>The Buffalo was one of the landlords in Laxmangarh. There were three others, and each had got</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18314;left:108"><nobr>his name from the peculiarities of appetite that had been detected in him.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18355;left:108"><nobr>The Stork was a fat man with a fat mustache, thick and curved and pointy at the tips. He owned</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18376;left:108"><nobr>the river that flowed outside the village, and he took a cut of every catch of fish caught by every</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18397;left:108"><nobr>fisherman in the river, and a toll from every boatman who crossed the river to come to our</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18417;left:108"><nobr>village.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18459;left:108"><nobr>His brother was called the Wild Boar. This fellow owned all the good agricultural land around</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18480;left:108"><nobr>Laxmangarh. If you wanted to work on those lands, you had to bow down to his feet, and touch</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18500;left:108"><nobr>the dust under his slippers, and agree to swallow his day wages. When he passed by women, his</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18521;left:108"><nobr>car would stop; the windows would roll down to reveal his grin; two of his teeth, on either side</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18542;left:108"><nobr>of his nose, were long and curved, like little tusks.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18583;left:108"><nobr>The Raven owned the worst land, which was the dry, rocky hillside around the fort, and took a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18604;left:108"><nobr>cut from the goatherds who went up there to graze with their flocks. If they didn't have their</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18624;left:108"><nobr>money, he liked to dip his beak into their backsides, so they called him the Raven.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18666;left:108"><nobr>The Buffalo was greediest of the lot. He had eaten up the rickshaws and the roads. So if you ran</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18687;left:108"><nobr>a rickshaw, or used the road, you had to pay him his feed—one-third of whatever you earned, no</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18707;left:108"><nobr>less.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18749;left:108"><nobr>All four of the Animals lived in high-walled mansions just outside Laxmangarh—the landlords'</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18770;left:108"><nobr>quarters. They had their own temples inside the mansions, and their own wells and ponds, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18790;left:108"><nobr>did not need to come out into the village except to feed. Once upon a time, the children of the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18811;left:108"><nobr>four Animals went around town in their own cars; Kusum remembered those days. But after the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18831;left:108"><nobr>Buffalo's son had been kidnapped by the Naxals—perhaps you've heard about them, Mr. Jiabao,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18852;left:108"><nobr>since they're Communists, just like you, and go around shooting rich people on principle—the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18873;left:108"><nobr>four Animals had sent their sons and daughters away, to Dhanbad or to Delhi.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18914;left:108"><nobr>Their children were gone, but the Animals stayed and fed on the village, and everything that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18935;left:108"><nobr>grew in it, until there was nothing left for anyone else to feed on. So the rest of the village left</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18956;left:108"><nobr>Laxmangarh for food. Each year, all the men in the village waited in a big group outside the tea</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18977;left:108"><nobr>shop. When the buses came, they got on—packing the inside, hanging from the railings,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:18997;left:108"><nobr>climbing onto the roofs—and went to Gaya; there they went to the station and rushed into the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19018;left:108"><nobr>trains—packing the inside, hanging from the railings, climbing onto the roofs—and went to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19039;left:108"><nobr>Delhi, Calcutta, and Dhanbad to find work. </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:19315;left:108"><nobr>A month before the rains, the men came back from Dhanbad and Delhi and Calcutta, leaner,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19336;left:108"><nobr>darker, angrier, but with money in their pockets. The women were waiting for them. They hid</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19357;left:108"><nobr>behind the door, and as soon as the men walked in, they pounced, like wildcats on a slab of flesh.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19378;left:108"><nobr>There was fighting and wailing and shrieking. My uncles would resist, and managed to keep</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19398;left:108"><nobr>some of their money, but my father got peeled and skinned every time. &quot;I survived the city, but I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19419;left:108"><nobr>couldn't survive the women in my home,&quot; he would say, sunk into a corner of the room. The</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19440;left:108"><nobr>women would feed him after they fed the buffalo.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19481;left:108"><nobr>I would come to him, and play around with him, by climbing his back, and passing my palm over</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19502;left:108"><nobr>his forehead—over his eyes—over his nose—and down to his neck, to the little depression at the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19523;left:108"><nobr>pit of his neck. I would let my finger linger there—it still is my favorite part of the human body.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19564;left:108"><nobr>A rich man's body is like a premium cotton pillow, white and soft and blank. <i>Ours </i>are different.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19585;left:108"><nobr>My father's spine was a knotted rope, the kind that women use in villages to pull water from</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19605;left:108"><nobr>wells; the clavicle curved around his neck in high relief, like a dog's collar; cuts and nicks and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19626;left:108"><nobr>scars, like little whip marks in his flesh, ran down his chest and waist, reaching down below his</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19647;left:108"><nobr>hip bones into his buttocks. The story of a poor man's life is written on his body, in a sharp pen.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19688;left:108"><nobr>My uncles also did backbreaking work, but they did what everyone else did. Each year, as soon</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19709;left:108"><nobr>as it began raining, they would go out to the fields with blackened sickles, begging one landlord</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19730;left:108"><nobr>or the other for some work. Then they cast seed, cut weeds, and harvested corn and paddy. My</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19750;left:108"><nobr>father could have worked with them; he could have worked with the landlords' mud, but he chose</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19771;left:108"><nobr>not to.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19812;left:108"><nobr>He chose to fight it.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19854;left:108"><nobr>Now, since I doubt that you have rickshaw-pullers in China—or in any other civilized nation on</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19875;left:108"><nobr>earth—you will have to see one for yourself. Rickshaws are not allowed inside the posh parts of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19895;left:108"><nobr>Delhi, where foreigners might see them and gape. Insist on going to Old Delhi, or Nizamuddin—</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19916;left:108"><nobr>there you'll see the road full of them—thin, sticklike men, leaning forward from the seat of a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19937;left:108"><nobr>bicycle, as they pedal along a carriage bearing a pyramid of middle-class flesh—some fat man</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19958;left:108"><nobr>with his fat wife and all their shopping bags and groceries.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:19999;left:108"><nobr>And when you see these stick-men, think of my father.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20040;left:108"><nobr>Rickshaw-puller he may have been—a human beast of burden—but my father was a man with a</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:20102;left:108"><nobr><i>I </i>was his plan.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20144;left:108"><nobr>One day he lost his temper at home and began yelling at the women. This was the day they told</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20165;left:108"><nobr>him that I had not been going to class. He did something he had never dared do before—he</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20185;left:108"><nobr>yelled at Kusum:</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:20503;left:108"><nobr>Kusum was startled, but only for a moment. She yelled back:</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20545;left:108"><nobr>&quot;This fellow came running back from school—don't blame me! He's a coward, and he eats too</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20566;left:108"><nobr>much. Put him to work in the tea shop and let him make some money.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20607;left:108"><nobr>My aunts and cousin-sisters gathered around her. I crawled behind my father's back as they told</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20628;left:108"><nobr>him the story of my cowardice.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20669;left:108"><nobr>Now, you may find it incredible that a boy in a village would be frightened of a lizard. Rats,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20690;left:108"><nobr>snakes, monkeys, and mongooses don't bother me at all. On the contrary—I <i>love </i>animals. But</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20707;left:108"><nobr>lizards…each time I see one, no matter how tiny, it's as if I turn into a girl. My blood freezes.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20752;left:108"><nobr>There was a giant cupboard in my classroom, whose door was always slightly ajar—no one knew</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20773;left:108"><nobr>what it was there for. One morning, the door creaked open, and a lizard jumped out.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20814;left:108"><nobr>It was light green in color, like a half-ripe guava. Its tongue flicked in and out of its mouth. It</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20835;left:108"><nobr>was at least two feet long.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20876;left:108"><nobr>The other boys barely noticed. Until someone saw my face. They gathered in a circle around me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20918;left:108"><nobr>Two of them pinned my hands behind my back and held my head still. Someone caught the thing</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20938;left:108"><nobr>in his hands, and began walking toward me with slow, exaggerated steps. Making no noise—</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20959;left:108"><nobr>only flicking its red tongue in and out of its mouth—the lizard came closer and closer to my face.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:20980;left:108"><nobr>The laughter grew louder. I couldn't make a noise. The teacher was snoring at his desk behind</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21000;left:108"><nobr>me. The lizard's face came right up to my face; and then it opened its light green mouth, and then</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21021;left:108"><nobr>I fainted for the second time in my life.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21063;left:108"><nobr>I had not gone back to school since that day.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21104;left:108"><nobr>My father did not laugh when he heard the story. He took a deep breath; I felt his chest</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21125;left:108"><nobr>expanding against me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21166;left:108"><nobr>&quot;You let Kishan drop out of school, but I told you this fellow had to stay in school. His mother</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21187;left:108"><nobr>told me he'd be the one who made it through school. His mother said—&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21228;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Oh, to hell with his mother!&quot; Kusum shouted. &quot;She was a crazy one, and she's dead, and thank</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21249;left:108"><nobr>goodness. Now listen to me: let the boy go to the tea shop like Kishan, that's what I say.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21290;left:108"><nobr>The next day my father came with me to my school, for the first and last time. It was dawn; the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21311;left:108"><nobr>place was empty. We pushed the door open. A dim blue light filled the classroom. Now, our</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21332;left:108"><nobr>schoolteacher was a big <i>paan</i>-and-spit man—and his expectorate made a sort of low, red</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21353;left:108"><nobr>wallpaper on three walls around us. When he went to sleep, which he usually did by noon, we</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21373;left:108"><nobr>stole <i>paan </i>from his pockets; distributed it amongst ourselves and chewed on it; and then,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21394;left:108"><nobr>imitating his spitting style—hands on hips, back arched slightly—took turns spitting at the three</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:21415;left:108"><nobr>dirty walls. </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:21961;left:108"><nobr>The teacher was lying in one corner of the room, reeking of booze, snoring soundly. Near him</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:22106;left:108"><nobr>But he wouldn't listen. He kicked the cupboard, and the lizard darted out, and he chased it again,</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:22188;left:108"><nobr>The air became acrid: a stench of crushed flesh. He picked the dead lizard up and flung it out the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:22313;left:108"><nobr>is that one son of mine—at least one—should live like a man.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22354;left:108"><nobr>What it meant to live like a man was a mystery. I thought it meant being like Vijay, the bus</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22375;left:108"><nobr>conductor. The bus stopped for half an hour at Laxmangarh, and the passengers got off, and the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22395;left:108"><nobr>conductor got down to have a cup of tea. Now, he was a man all of us who worked in that tea</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22416;left:108"><nobr>shop looked up to. We admired his bus-company-issue khaki uniform, his silver whistle and the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22437;left:108"><nobr>red cord from which it hung down from his pocket. Everything about him said: he had made it in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22458;left:108"><nobr>life.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22499;left:108"><nobr>Vijay's family were pigherds, which meant they were the lowest of the low, yet he had made it</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22520;left:108"><nobr>up in life. Somehow he had befriended a politician. People said he had let the politician dip his</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:22541;left:108"><nobr>beak in his backside. Whatever he had to do, he had done: he was the first entrepreneur I knew</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:23749;left:108"><nobr>The teacher had a legitimate excuse to steal the money—he said he hadn't been paid his salary in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:23770;left:108"><nobr>six months. He was going to undertake a Gandhian protest to retrieve his missing wages—he was</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:24067;left:108"><nobr>are numerous. Once, a truck came into the school with uniforms that the government had sent for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24088;left:108"><nobr>us; we never saw them, but a week later they turned up for sale in the neighboring village.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:24254;left:108"><nobr>my school. We gathered at the door to stare at his suit. He had a cane in his hand, which he</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24275;left:108"><nobr>began swishing when he saw us at the door. We rushed back into the class and sat down with our</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24295;left:108"><nobr>books.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24337;left:108"><nobr>This was a surprise inspection.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24378;left:108"><nobr>The man in the blue safari suit—the inspector—pointed his cane at holes in the wall, or the red</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:24440;left:108"><nobr>&quot;There is no duster in this class; there are no chairs; there are no uniforms for the boys. How</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24461;left:108"><nobr>much money have you stolen from the school funds, you sister-fucker?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24502;left:108"><nobr>The inspector wrote four sentences on the board and pointed his cane at a boy:</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:24585;left:108"><nobr>One boy after the other stood up and blinked at the wall.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24627;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Try Balram, sir,&quot; the teacher said. &quot;He's the smartest of the lot. He reads well.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24668;left:108"><nobr>So I stood up, and read, <i>&quot;We live in a glorious land. The Lord Buddha received his</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24689;left:108"><nobr><i>enlightenment in this land. The River Ganga gives life to our plants and our animals and our</i></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:24751;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Good,&quot; the inspector said. &quot;And who was the Lord Buddha?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24792;left:108"><nobr>&quot;An enlightened man.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24834;left:108"><nobr>&quot;An enlightened <i>god.</i>&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:24917;left:108"><nobr>The inspector made me write my name on the blackboard; then he showed me his wristwatch and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:24937;left:108"><nobr>asked me to read the time. He took out his wallet, removed a small photo, and asked me, &quot;Who is</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:25235;left:108"><nobr>The photo was of a plump man with spiky white hair and chubby cheeks, wearing thick earrings</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:25338;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Good. And what is the Great Socialist's message for little children?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25380;left:108"><nobr>I had seen the answer on the wall outside the temple: a policeman had written it one day in red</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:25504;left:108"><nobr>The inspector pointed his cane straight at me. &quot;You, young man, are an intelligent, honest,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25525;left:108"><nobr>vivacious fellow in this crowd of thugs and idiots. In any jungle, what is the rarest of animals—</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25545;left:108"><nobr>the creature that comes along only once in a generation?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25587;left:108"><nobr>I thought about it and said:</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25628;left:108"><nobr>&quot;The white tiger.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25670;left:108"><nobr>&quot;That's what you are, in <i>this </i>jungle.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25711;left:108"><nobr>Before he left, the inspector said, &quot;I'll write to Patna asking them to send you a scholarship. You</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25732;left:108"><nobr>need to go to a real school—somewhere far away from here. You need a real uniform, and a real</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25752;left:108"><nobr>education.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25794;left:108"><nobr>He had a parting gift for me—a book. I remember the title very well: <i>Lessons for Young Boys</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25815;left:108"><nobr><i>from the Life of Mahatma Gandhi.</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25856;left:108"><nobr>So that's how I became the White Tiger. There will be a fourth and a fifth name too, but that's</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25877;left:108"><nobr>late in the story.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25918;left:108"><nobr>Now, being praised by the school inspector in front of my teacher and fellow students, being</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25939;left:108"><nobr>called a &quot;White Tiger,&quot; being given a book, and being promised a scholarship: all this constituted</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25959;left:108"><nobr>good news, and the one infallible law of life in the Darkness is that good news becomes bad</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:25980;left:108"><nobr>news—and soon.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26022;left:108"><nobr>My cousin-sister Reena got hitched off to a boy in the next village. Because we were the girl's</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26042;left:108"><nobr>family, we were screwed. We had to give the boy a new bicycle, and cash, and a silver bracelet,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26063;left:108"><nobr>and arrange for a big wedding—which we did. Mr. Premier, you probably know how we Indians</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26084;left:108"><nobr>enjoy our weddings—I gather that these days people come from other countries to get married</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26105;left:108"><nobr>Indian-style. Oh, we could have taught those foreigners a thing or two, I tell you! Film songs</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26125;left:108"><nobr>blasting out from a black tape recorder, and drinking and dancing all night! I got smashed, and so</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26146;left:108"><nobr>did Kishan, and so did everyone in the family, and for all I know, they probably poured hooch</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:26443;left:108"><nobr>Two or three days passed. I was in my classroom, sitting at the back, with the black slate and</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:26485;left:108"><nobr>on my own. The boys were chatting or fighting. The teacher had passed out.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:26609;left:108"><nobr>Still he said nothing.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:26692;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Why not?&quot; he said. And then, with his hand on my head, he led me out.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26733;left:108"><nobr>The family had taken a big loan from the Stork so they could have a lavish wedding and a lavish</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26754;left:108"><nobr>dowry for my cousin-sister. Now the Stork had called in his loan. He wanted all the members of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26775;left:108"><nobr>the family working for him and he had seen me in school, or his collector had. So they had to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26796;left:108"><nobr>hand me over too.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26837;left:108"><nobr>I was taken to the tea shop. Kishan folded his hands and bowed to the shopkeeper. I bowed to the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26858;left:108"><nobr>shopkeeper too.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26899;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Who's this?&quot; The shopkeeper squinted at me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26940;left:108"><nobr>He was sitting under a huge portrait of Mahatma Gandhi, and I knew already that I was going to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:26961;left:108"><nobr>be in big trouble.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27003;left:108"><nobr>&quot;My brother,&quot; Kishan said. &quot;He's come to join me.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27044;left:108"><nobr>Then Kishan dragged the oven out from the tea shop and told me to sit down. I sat down next to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27065;left:108"><nobr>him. He brought a gunnysack; inside was a huge pile of coals. He took out a coal, smashed it on</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27086;left:108"><nobr>a brick, and then poured the black chunks into the oven.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27127;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Harder,&quot; he said, when I hit the coal against the brick. &quot;Harder, harder.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27168;left:108"><nobr>Finally I got it right—I broke the coal against the brick. He got up and said, &quot;Now break every</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27189;left:108"><nobr>last coal in this bag like that.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27230;left:108"><nobr>A little later, two boys came around from school to watch me. Then two more boys came; then</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27251;left:108"><nobr>two more. I heard giggling.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:27293;left:108"><nobr>&quot;What is the creature that comes along only once in a generation?&quot; one boy asked loudly.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:29006;left:108"><nobr>India. Now, a busload of men in khaki—it was a sensational case, after all—must have gone to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29027;left:108"><nobr>Laxmangarh when investigating my disappearance. They would have questioned the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29047;left:108"><nobr>shopkeepers, bullied the rickshaw puller, and woken up the schoolteacher. Did he steal as a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29068;left:108"><nobr>child? Did he sleep with whores? They would have smashed up a grocery shop or two, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29089;left:108"><nobr>forced out &quot;confessions&quot; from one or two people.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29130;left:108"><nobr>Yet I bet you they missed the most important clue of all, which was right in front of them:</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29172;left:108"><nobr>I am talking of the Black Fort, of course.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29213;left:108"><nobr>I begged Kusum many times to take me to the top of the hill, and through the entranceway, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29234;left:108"><nobr>into the fort. But she said I was a coward, I would die of fright if I went up there: an enormous</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29254;left:108"><nobr>lizard, the biggest in the whole world, lived in the fort.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29296;left:108"><nobr>So I could only watch. The long loopholes in its wall turned into lines of burning pink at sunrise</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29316;left:108"><nobr>and burning gold at sunset; the blue sky shone through the slits in the stone, while the moon</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29337;left:108"><nobr>shone on the jagged ramparts, and the monkeys ran wild along the walls, shrieking and attacking</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29358;left:108"><nobr>each other, as if they were the spirits of the dead warriors reincarnated, refighting their final</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29379;left:108"><nobr>battles.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29420;left:108"><nobr>I wanted to go up there too.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29462;left:108"><nobr>Iqbal, who is one of the four best poets in the world—the others being Rumi, Mirza Ghalib, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29482;left:108"><nobr>a fourth fellow, also a Muslim, whose name I've forgotten—has written a poem where he says</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29503;left:108"><nobr>this about slaves:</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:29544;left:108"><nobr><i>They remain slaves because they can't see what is beautiful in this world.</i></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:30007;left:108"><nobr>Even as a boy I could see what was beautiful in the world: I was destined not to stay a slave.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30049;left:108"><nobr>One day Kusum found out about me and the fort. She followed me all the way from our home to</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:30111;left:108"><nobr>life, I'll tell you that right now.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30153;left:108"><nobr>When I was maybe thirteen I decided to go up to the fort on my own. I waded into the pond, got</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30173;left:108"><nobr>to the other side, and climbed up the hill; just as I was on the verge of going in, a black thing</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30194;left:108"><nobr>materialized in the entranceway. I spun around and ran back down the hill, too frightened even to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30215;left:108"><nobr>cry.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30256;left:108"><nobr>It was only a cow. I could see this from a distance, but I was too shaken up to go back.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30297;left:108"><nobr>I tried many more times, yet I was such a coward that each time I tried to go up, I lost my nerve</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30318;left:108"><nobr>and came back.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30360;left:108"><nobr>At the age of twenty-four, when I was living in Dhanbad and working in Mr. Ashok's service as</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30380;left:108"><nobr>a chauffeur, I returned to Laxmangarh when my master and his wife went there on an excursion.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30401;left:108"><nobr>It was a very important trip for me, and one I hope to describe in greater detail when time</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30422;left:108"><nobr>permits. For now, all I want to tell you is this: While Mr. Ashok and Pinky Madam were</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30442;left:108"><nobr>relaxing, having eaten lunch, I had nothing to do, so I decided to try again. I swam through the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30463;left:108"><nobr>pond, walked up the hill, went into the doorway, and entered the Black Fort for the first time.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30484;left:108"><nobr>There wasn't much around—just some broken walls and a bunch of frightened monkeys</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30504;left:108"><nobr>watching me from a distance. Putting my foot on the wall, I looked down on the village from</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30525;left:108"><nobr>there. My little Laxmangarh. I saw the temple tower, the market, the glistening line of sewage,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30546;left:108"><nobr>the landlords' mansions—and my own house, with that dark little cloud outside—the water</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30567;left:108"><nobr>buffalo. It looked like the most beautiful sight on earth.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30608;left:108"><nobr>I leaned out from the edge of the fort in the direction of my village—and then I did something</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30629;left:108"><nobr>too disgusting to describe to you.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:30670;left:108"><nobr>Well, actually, I <i>spat</i>. Again and again. And then, whistling and humming, I went back down the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:31920;left:108"><nobr>service—reflected in my rearview mirror. It was such a handsome face that sometimes I couldn't</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31941;left:108"><nobr>take my eyes off it. Picture a six-foot-tall fellow, broad-shouldered, with a landlord's powerful,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31962;left:108"><nobr>punishing forearms; yet always gentle (<i>almost </i>always—except for that time he punched Pinky</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:31982;left:108"><nobr>Madam in the face) and kind to those around him, even his servants and driver.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32024;left:108"><nobr>Now another face appears, to the side of his, in memory's mirror. Pinky Madam—his wife. Every</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:32591;left:108"><nobr>protecting his good name. I owe him so much. He and Pinky Madam would sit in the back of the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:32632;left:108"><nobr>by eavesdropping on them, I learned a lot about life, India, and America—and a bit of English</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32653;left:108"><nobr>too. (Perhaps a bit more than I've let on so far—!) Many of my best ideas are, in fact, borrowed</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32673;left:108"><nobr>from my ex-employer or his brother or someone else whom I was driving about. (I confess, Mr.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32694;left:108"><nobr>Premier: I am not an original thinker—but I am an original <i>listener</i>.) True, eventually Mr. Ashok</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32715;left:108"><nobr>and I had a disagreement or two about an English term—<i>income tax</i>—and things began to sour</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32736;left:108"><nobr>between us, but that messy stuff comes later on in the story. Right now we're still on best of</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:32839;left:108"><nobr>different politicians before three different elections. When he began spitting blood that morning,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32860;left:108"><nobr>Kishan and I took him by boat across the river. We kept washing his mouth with water from the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:32922;left:108"><nobr>There was a rickshaw-puller on the other side of the river who recognized my father; he took the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32943;left:108"><nobr>three of us for free to the government hospital.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:32984;left:108"><nobr>There were three black goats sitting on the steps to the large, faded white building; the stench of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33005;left:108"><nobr>goat feces wafted out from the open door. The glass in most of the windows was broken; a cat</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33026;left:108"><nobr>was staring out at us from one cracked window.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:33067;left:108"><nobr>A sign on the gate said:</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:33233;left:108"><nobr>after we bribed him ten rupees, said that a doctor might come in the evening. The doors to the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:35381;left:108"><nobr>off to Dhanbad. My cousin Dilip and I came along with him. We three found work in a tea shop</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:35402;left:108"><nobr>in Dhanbad—the owner had heard good things about Kishan's work at the tea shop in</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:35463;left:108"><nobr>Luckily for us, he hadn't heard anything about me.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:35629;left:108"><nobr>I did my job with near total dishonesty, lack of dedication, and insincerity—and so the tea shop</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:36113;left:108"><nobr>had been using to stir the sugar, and whack me on the head with it. The burning syrup singed me</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:36155;left:108"><nobr>mistake for vitiligo or another skin disease; a network of pink by which you can still identify me,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36175;left:108"><nobr>although the police, predictably, missed it.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36217;left:108"><nobr>Eventually I got sent home. No one else in Laxmangarh would hire me after that, even as a field</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:36403;left:108"><nobr>There was money in the air in Dhanbad. I saw buildings with sides made entirely of glass, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36424;left:108"><nobr>men with gold in their teeth. And all this glass and gold—all of it came from the coal pits.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36444;left:108"><nobr>Outside the town, there was coal, more coal than you would find anywhere else in the Darkness,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:36465;left:108"><nobr>maybe more coal than anywhere else in the world. Miners came to eat at my tea shop—I always</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:36527;left:108"><nobr>They said that the coal mines went on and on for miles and miles outside the town. In some</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:36610;left:108"><nobr>And it was at the tea shop in this city built by coal, while wiping a table and lingering to</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:39007;left:108"><nobr>coals to make ice for you. Mastering a car&quot;—he moved the stick of an invisible gearbox—&quot;it's</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:39027;left:108"><nobr>like taming a wild stallion—only a boy from the warrior castes can manage that. You need to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:39048;left:108"><nobr>have aggression in your blood. Muslims, Rajputs, Sikhs—they're fighters, they can become</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:39069;left:108"><nobr>drivers. You think sweet-makers can last long in fourth gear?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:39110;left:108"><nobr>Coal was taught to make ice, starting the next morning at six. Three hundred rupees, plus a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:39131;left:108"><nobr>bonus, will do that. We practiced in a taxi. Each time I made a mistake with the gears, he slapped</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:39152;left:108"><nobr>me on the skull. &quot;Why don't you stick to sweets and tea?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:39193;left:108"><nobr>For every hour I spent in the car, he made me spend two or three under it—I was made a free</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:39214;left:108"><nobr>repair mechanic for all the taxis in the stand; late every evening, I emerged from under a taxi like</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:39235;left:108"><nobr>a hog from sewage, my face black with grease, my hands shiny with engine oil. I dipped into a </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:39532;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Listen,&quot; the old driver said when I was handing him over the hundred rupees he had been</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:39553;left:108"><nobr>promised as bonus. &quot;It's not enough to drive. You've got to become a <i>driver</i>. You've got to get</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:39574;left:108"><nobr>the right attitude, understand? Anyone tries to overtake you on the road, do this&quot;—he clenched</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:39594;left:108"><nobr>his fist and shook it—&quot;and call him a sister-fucker a few times. The road is a jungle, get it? A</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:39615;left:108"><nobr>good driver must roar to get ahead on it.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:39657;left:108"><nobr>He patted me on the back.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:39698;left:108"><nobr>&quot;You're better than I thought—you <i>are </i>a surprise package, little fellow. I've got a reward for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:39719;left:108"><nobr>you.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:39760;left:108"><nobr>He walked; I followed. It was evening. We went through dim streets and markets. We walked for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:39781;left:108"><nobr>half an hour, while everything around us grew dark—and then it was as if we had stepped out</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:39801;left:108"><nobr>into fireworks.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:39843;left:108"><nobr>The street was full of colored doors and colored windows, and in each door and each window, a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:39864;left:108"><nobr>woman was looking out at me with a big smile. Ribbons of red paper and silver foil glittered</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:39884;left:108"><nobr>between the rooftops of the street; tea was being boiled in stalls by the sides of the road. Four</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:39905;left:108"><nobr>men rushed at us at once. The old driver explained that they should keep away, since it was my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:39926;left:108"><nobr>first time. &quot;Let him enjoy the sights first. That's the best part of this game, isn't it—the looking!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:39967;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Sure, sure,&quot; the men said, and stepped back. &quot;That's what we want him to do—enjoy!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:40008;left:108"><nobr>I walked with the old driver, my mouth open, gaping at all the gorgeous women jeering and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:40029;left:108"><nobr>taunting me from behind their grilled windows—all of them begging me to dip my beak into</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:40050;left:108"><nobr>them!</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:40091;left:108"><nobr>The old driver explained the nature of the wares on offer. Up in one building, sitting on a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:40112;left:108"><nobr>windowsill in such a way that we could see the full spread of their gleaming dark legs, were the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:40133;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Americans&quot;: girls in short skirts and high platform shoes, carrying pink handbags with names in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:40154;left:108"><nobr>English written on them in sequins. They were slim and athletic—for men who like the Western</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:40174;left:108"><nobr>kind. In this corner, sitting in the threshold of an open house, the &quot;traditionals&quot;—fat, chunky</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:40195;left:108"><nobr>types in saris, for those who like value for their money. There were eunuchs in one window—</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:40215;left:108"><nobr>teenagers in the next window. The face of a small boy appeared from between a woman's legs</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:40236;left:108"><nobr>and then vanished.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:40278;left:108"><nobr>A blinding flash of light: a blue door opened, and four light-skinned Nepali women, in gorgeous</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:40298;left:108"><nobr>red petticoats, looked out.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:40340;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Them!&quot; I shouted. &quot;Them! Them! Them!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:40381;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Good,&quot; the old driver said. &quot;I like that too—I always go for the foreign ones.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:40423;left:108"><nobr>We went in, and he picked a woman from the four, and I picked another woman, and we went </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:40679;left:108"><nobr>into two rooms, and the woman I picked closed the door behind me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:40720;left:108"><nobr>My first time!</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:40762;left:108"><nobr>Half an hour later, when the old driver and I staggered back, drunk and happy, to his house, I put</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:40782;left:108"><nobr>coals in his hookah. I brought him the hookah and watched as he took a deep, contented suck on</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:40803;left:108"><nobr>the pipe. Smoke came out of his nostrils.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:40845;left:108"><nobr>&quot;What is it now? I've taught you to be a driver and a man—what more do you want?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:40882;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Sir…can't you ask the taxi men if they need someone? I'll work for free at first. I need a job.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:40927;left:108"><nobr>The old driver laughed. &quot;I haven't had work in forty years, you nitwit. How the fuck can I help</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:40948;left:108"><nobr>you? Now get lost.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:40989;left:108"><nobr>So, next morning, I was walking from house to house, knocking on gates and on front doors of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:41010;left:108"><nobr>the rich, asking if anyone wanted a driver—a good driver—an experienced driver—for their car.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:41052;left:108"><nobr>Everyone said no. You didn't get a job that way. You had to know someone in the family to get a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:41072;left:108"><nobr>job. Not by knocking on the gate and asking.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:41114;left:108"><nobr>There's no reward for entrepreneurship in most of India, Your Excellency. It's a sad fact.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:41155;left:108"><nobr>Every evening I came home tired and close to tears, but Kishan said, &quot;Keep trying. Someone will</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:41176;left:108"><nobr>say yes in the end.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:41217;left:108"><nobr>So I went looking, from house to house, house to house, house to house. Finally, after two weeks</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:41238;left:108"><nobr>of asking and being told to get lost, I got to a house with ten-foot-high walls, and a cage of iron</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:41259;left:108"><nobr>grilles around each window.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:41300;left:108"><nobr>A sly, slant-eyed Nepali with a white mustache peered at me through the bars of the gate.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:41342;left:108"><nobr>&quot;What do you want?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:41383;left:108"><nobr>I didn't like the way he asked that one bit; I put a big smile on my face.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:41424;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Any need of a driver, sir? I've got four years' experience. My master recently died, so I—&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:41466;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Fuck off. We have a driver already,&quot; the Nepali said. He twirled a big bunch of keys and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:41486;left:108"><nobr>grinned.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:41528;left:108"><nobr>My heart sank, and I was about to turn away—when I saw a figure on the terrace, a fellow in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:41549;left:108"><nobr>long loose white clothes, walking around and around, lost deep in thought. I swear by God, sir—</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:41569;left:108"><nobr>I swear by all thirty-six million and four of them—the moment I saw his face, I knew: <i>This is the</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:41590;left:108"><nobr><i>master for me.</i></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:41867;left:108"><nobr>Some dark fate had tied his lifeline to mine, because at that very moment he looked down.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:41908;left:108"><nobr>I knew he was coming down to save me. I just had to divert this Nepali fucker as long as</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:41929;left:108"><nobr>possible.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:41970;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I'm a good driver, sir. I don't smoke, I don't drink, I don't steal.&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:42177;left:108"><nobr>Just then, the door of the house opened. But it was not the man on the terrace—it was an older</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42198;left:108"><nobr>man, with a big white mustache that was thick, and curved, and pointy at the tips.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42240;left:108"><nobr>&quot;What is going on, Ram Bahadur?&quot; he asked the Nepali.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42281;left:108"><nobr>&quot;He's begging, sir. Begging for money.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42322;left:108"><nobr>I banged on the gate. &quot;I am from your village, sir. I am from Laxmangarh! The village near the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42343;left:108"><nobr>Black Fort! Your village!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42384;left:108"><nobr>The old man was the Stork!</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42426;left:108"><nobr>He stared at me for the longest time, and then he told the Nepali guard, &quot;Let the boy in.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42467;left:108"><nobr>Swoosh!—As soon as the gate was open, I dived straight at the Stork's feet. No Olympic runner</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42488;left:108"><nobr>could have gone in as fast as I did through those gates; the Nepali had no chance at all of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42509;left:108"><nobr>blocking me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42550;left:108"><nobr>You should have seen me that day—what a performance of wails and kisses and tears! You'd</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42571;left:108"><nobr>think I'd been born into a caste of performing actors! And all the time, while clutching the Stork's</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42591;left:108"><nobr>feet, I was staring at his huge, dirty, uncut toenails, and thinking, <i>What is he doing in Dhanbad?</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42612;left:108"><nobr><i>Why isn't he back home, screwing poor fishermen of their money and humping their daughters?</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42654;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Get up, boy,&quot; he said—big, uncut toenails scratched my cheeks. Mr. Ashok—the man on the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42674;left:108"><nobr>terrace, of course—was by his side now.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42716;left:108"><nobr>&quot;You're <i>really </i>from Laxmangarh?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42757;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Yes, sir. I used to work in the tea shop—the one with the big photo of Gandhi in it. I used to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:42778;left:108"><nobr>break coals there. You came once to have tea.&quot; </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:43051;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Ah…the old village.&quot; He closed his eyes. &quot;Do people there still remember me? It's been three</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43075;left:108"><nobr>years since I was there.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43117;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Of course, sir—people say, 'Our father is gone, Thakur Ramdev is gone, the best of the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43138;left:108"><nobr>landlords is gone, who will protect us now?'&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43179;left:108"><nobr>The Stork enjoyed hearing that. He turned to Mr. Ashok. &quot;Let's see how good he is. Call Mukesh</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43200;left:108"><nobr>too. Let's go for a spin.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43241;left:108"><nobr>Only later did I understand how lucky I'd been. Mr. Ashok had come back from America just the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43262;left:108"><nobr>previous day; a car had been bought for him. A driver was needed for the car. And on that day I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43283;left:108"><nobr>had turned up.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43324;left:108"><nobr>Now, there were two cars in the garage. One was your standard Maruti Suzuki—that little white</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43345;left:108"><nobr>car you see all over India—and the other was the Honda City. Now, the Maruti is a small, simple</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43365;left:108"><nobr>fellow, a perfect servant to the driver; the moment you turn the ignition key, he does exactly</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43386;left:108"><nobr>what the driver wants him to. The Honda City is a larger car, a more sophisticated creature, with</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43407;left:108"><nobr>a mind of his own; he has power steering, and an advanced engine, and he does what <i>he </i>wants to.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43428;left:108"><nobr>Given that I was so nervous then, if the Stork had told me to take the driving test in the Honda</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43448;left:108"><nobr>City, that would have been the end of me, sir. But luck was on my side.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43490;left:108"><nobr>They made me drive the Maruti Suzuki.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43531;left:108"><nobr>The Stork and Mr. Ashok got into the back; a small dark man—Mukesh Sir, the Stork's other</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43552;left:108"><nobr>son—got into the front seat and gave me orders. The Nepali guard watched with a darkened face</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43572;left:108"><nobr>as I took the car out of the gates—and into the city of Dhanbad.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43614;left:108"><nobr>They made me drive them around for half an hour, and then told me to head back.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43655;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Not bad,&quot; the old man said as he got out of the car. &quot;Fellow is cautious and good. What's your</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:43718;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Halwai.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43755;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Halwai…&quot; He turned to the small dark man. &quot;What caste is that, top or bottom?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43800;left:108"><nobr>And I knew that my future depended on the answer to this question.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43842;left:441"><nobr>* * *</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43881;left:108"><nobr>I should explain a thing or two about caste. Even Indians get confused about this word,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43902;left:108"><nobr>especially educated Indians in the cities. They'll make a mess of explaining it to you. But it's</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43922;left:108"><nobr>simple, really.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:43963;left:108"><nobr>Let's start with me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44005;left:108"><nobr>See: Halwai, my name, means &quot;sweet-maker.&quot; </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:44284;left:108"><nobr>at once. That's why Kishan and I kept getting jobs at sweetshops wherever we went. The owner</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44305;left:108"><nobr>thought, <i>Ah, they're Halwais, making sweets and tea is in their blood.</i></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:44553;left:108"><nobr>strange men.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44595;left:108"><nobr>And then, thanks to all those politicians in Delhi, on the fifteenth of August, 1947—the day the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44616;left:108"><nobr>British left—the cages had been let open; and the animals had attacked and ripped each other</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44636;left:108"><nobr>apart and jungle law replaced zoo law. Those that were the most ferocious, the hungriest, had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44657;left:108"><nobr>eaten everyone else up, and grown big bellies. That was all that counted now, the size of your</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44678;left:108"><nobr>belly. It didn't matter whether you were a woman, or a Muslim, or an untouchable: anyone with a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44698;left:108"><nobr>belly could rise up. My father's father must have been a real Halwai, a sweet-maker, but when he</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44719;left:108"><nobr>inherited the shop, a member of some other caste must have stolen it from him with the help of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44740;left:108"><nobr>the police. My father had not had the belly to fight back. That's why he had fallen all the way to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44760;left:108"><nobr>the mud, to the level of a rickshaw-puller. That's why I was cheated of my destiny to be fat, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44781;left:108"><nobr>creamy-skinned, and smiling.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44823;left:108"><nobr>To sum up—in the old days there were one thousand castes and destinies in India. These days,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44843;left:108"><nobr>there are just two castes: Men with Big Bellies, and Men with Small Bellies.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44885;left:108"><nobr>And only two destinies: eat—or get eaten up.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44926;left:441"><nobr>* * *</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44965;left:108"><nobr>Now, the dark man—Mukesh Sir, brother of Mr. Ashok—did not know the answer—I told you</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:44986;left:108"><nobr>that people in the cities know nothing much about the caste system, so the Stork turned to me</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45007;left:108"><nobr>and asked me directly.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45048;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Are you from a top caste or bottom caste, boy?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45090;left:108"><nobr>I didn't know what he wanted me to say, so I flipped both answers—I could probably have made</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45110;left:108"><nobr>a good case either way—and then said, &quot;Bottom, sir.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45151;left:108"><nobr>Turning to Mukesh Sir, the old man said, &quot;All our employees are top caste. It won't hurt to have</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45172;left:108"><nobr>one or two bottom castes working for us.&quot; </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:45534;left:108"><nobr>&quot;No, sir. In my caste, we never drink.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45572;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Halwai…&quot; Mr. Ashok said with a grin. &quot;Are you a sweet-maker? Can you cook for us while</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45597;left:108"><nobr>you're not driving?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45638;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Certainly, sir. I cook very well. Very tasty sweets. <i>Gulab jamuns, laddoos, </i>anything you</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45659;left:108"><nobr>desire,&quot; I said. &quot;I worked at a tea shop for many years.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45700;left:108"><nobr>Mr. Ashok seemed to find this amusing. &quot;Only in India,&quot; he said. &quot;Your driver can also make</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45721;left:108"><nobr>sweets for you. Only in India. Start from tomorrow.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45762;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Not so fast,&quot; Mukesh Sir said. &quot;First we have to ask about his family. How many are they,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45783;left:108"><nobr>where they live, everything. And one more thing: how much do you want?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45824;left:108"><nobr>Another test.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45866;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Absolutely nothing, sir. You're like a father and mother to me, and how can I ask for money</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45886;left:108"><nobr>from my parents?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45928;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Eight hundred rupees a month,&quot; he said.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:45969;left:108"><nobr>&quot;No, sir, please—it's too much. Give me half of that, it's enough. More than enough.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46011;left:108"><nobr>&quot;If we keep you beyond two months, it'll go to one thousand five hundred.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46052;left:108"><nobr>Looking suitably devastated, I accepted the money from him.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46094;left:108"><nobr>Mukesh Sir was not yet convinced about me. He looked me up and down and said, &quot;He's young.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46114;left:108"><nobr>Don't we want someone older?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46155;left:108"><nobr>The Stork shook his head. &quot;Catch 'em young, and you can keep 'em for life. A driver in his</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46176;left:108"><nobr>forties, you get, what, twenty years of service, then his eyes fail. This fellow will last thirty,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46197;left:108"><nobr>thirty-five years. His teeth are solid, he's got his hair, he's in good shape.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46238;left:108"><nobr>He sucked on his betel juice, which was filling up his mouth, turned, and spat out a jet of red</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46259;left:108"><nobr>liquid to the side.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46301;left:108"><nobr>Then he told me to come back in two days.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46342;left:108"><nobr>He must have phoned his man in Laxmangarh. And then that man must have gone and spoken to</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:46702;left:108"><nobr>That last piece of information was <i>very </i>important. They had to know where my family was, at all</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46722;left:108"><nobr>times.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46764;left:108"><nobr>I have not told you yet, have I, about what the Buffalo did to his domestic servant. The one who</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46785;left:108"><nobr>was supposed to guard his infant son, who got kidnapped by the Naxals and then tortured and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46805;left:108"><nobr>killed. The servant was one of our caste, sir. A Halwai. I had seen him once or twice when I was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46826;left:108"><nobr>a boy.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46867;left:108"><nobr>The servant said he had nothing to do with the kidnapping; the Buffalo did not believe him and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46888;left:108"><nobr>got four of his hired gunmen to torture the servant. Then they shot him through the head.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46929;left:108"><nobr>Fair enough. I would do the same to someone who let my son get kidnapped.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46971;left:108"><nobr>But then, because the Buffalo was sure that the man had deliberately let the child be kidnapped,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:46992;left:108"><nobr>for money, he also went after the servant's family. One brother was set upon while working in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47012;left:108"><nobr>the fields; beaten to death there. That brother's wife was finished off by three men working</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47033;left:108"><nobr>together. A sister, still unmarried, was also finished off. Then the house where the family had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47054;left:108"><nobr>lived was surrounded by the four henchmen and set on fire.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47095;left:108"><nobr>Now, who would want this to happen to his family, sir? Which inhuman wretch of a monster</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47116;left:108"><nobr>would consign his own granny and brother and aunt and nephews and nieces to death?</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47157;left:108"><nobr>The Stork and his sons could count on my loyalty.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47199;left:108"><nobr>When I came back, the Nepali guard opened the gate without a word. I was inside the compound</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47219;left:108"><nobr>now.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47261;left:108"><nobr>As far as masters go, Mr. Ashok, Mukesh Sir, and the Stork were better than nine in ten. There</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47282;left:108"><nobr>was always enough food in the house for the servants. On Sundays you even got a special dish,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47302;left:108"><nobr>rice mixed with small red chunks of boneless chicken. I had never had a regular chicken dish in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47323;left:108"><nobr>my life until then; it made you feel like a king, eating chicken Sunday after Sunday and then</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47343;left:108"><nobr>licking your fingers. I had a covered room to sleep in. True, I had to share it with the other</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47364;left:108"><nobr>driver, a grim-looking fellow named Ram Persad, and he had the nice big bed, while I had to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47385;left:108"><nobr>sleep on the floor—still a covered room's a covered room, and much nicer than sleeping on the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47406;left:108"><nobr>road, as Kishan and I had been doing all the time we were in Dhanbad. Above all, I got the thing</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47426;left:108"><nobr>that we who grow up in the Darkness value most of all. A uniform. A <i>khaki </i>uniform!</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47468;left:108"><nobr>The next day I went to the bank—the one that had a wall made all of glass. I saw myself</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47489;left:108"><nobr>reflected in the glass panes—all in khaki. I walked back and forth in front of that bank a dozen</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:47890;left:108"><nobr>talk for a few minutes before the Nepali shouted, &quot;That's enough—the boy has work to do now!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47931;left:108"><nobr>The work of a number two driver was simple. If the number one driver, Ram Persad, was busy</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47952;left:108"><nobr>driving the masters around town in the Honda City, and someone in the house wanted to go to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47973;left:108"><nobr>the market, or to a coal mine, or to the train station, I got into the Maruti Suzuki and drove them</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:47993;left:108"><nobr>there. Otherwise I had to stay around the house and make myself useful.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48035;left:108"><nobr>Now, I say they took me on as their &quot;driver.&quot; I don't exactly know how you organize your</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48055;left:108"><nobr>servants in China. But in India—or, at least, in the Darkness—the rich don't have drivers, cooks,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48076;left:108"><nobr>barbers, and tailors. They simply have servants.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48117;left:108"><nobr>What I mean is that anytime I was not driving the car, I had to sweep the floor of the courtyard,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48138;left:108"><nobr>make tea, clean cobwebs with a long broom, or chase a cow out of the compound. There was one</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48159;left:108"><nobr>thing I was not allowed to do, and this was to touch the Honda City: Ram Persad alone had the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48180;left:108"><nobr>right to drive it and clean it. In the evenings I'd watch him wash the sleek exterior of the car with</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48200;left:108"><nobr>a soft cloth. And I'd burn with envy.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48242;left:108"><nobr>I could see, even from outside, that this was a beautiful, modern car, with all the necessary</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48262;left:108"><nobr>comforts: a speaker system, A/C, nice glossy leather seats, and a big stainless-steel spittoon in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48283;left:108"><nobr>the back. It must be like paradise to drive such a nice car. All I had was a battered old Maruti</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48304;left:108"><nobr>Suzuki.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48345;left:108"><nobr>One evening, as I was watching, Mr. Ashok came and poked his nose around the car. I was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48366;left:108"><nobr>discovering that he was a very inquisitive man.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48407;left:108"><nobr>&quot;What's that for? That shiny thing in the back.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48449;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Spittoon, sir.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48490;left:108"><nobr>&quot;What?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48531;left:108"><nobr>Ram Persad explained. This spittoon was for the Stork, who liked to chew <i>paan</i>. If he spat the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48552;left:108"><nobr><i>paan </i>out the window the <i>paan </i>might streak the sides of the car, so he spat near his feet, into the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48573;left:108"><nobr>spittoon, which the driver washed and cleaned at the end of every ride.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48614;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Disgusting,&quot; Mr. Ashok said.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:48656;left:108"><nobr>He was asking about something else when Mukesh Sir's son Roshan came running up to us with</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:49347;left:108"><nobr>The Stork had a special use for driver number two. He had bad legs, with blue veins in them, and</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:49388;left:108"><nobr>have them massaged by a servant.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49430;left:108"><nobr>I had to heat water on the stove, carry it into the courtyard, and then lift the old man's feet up one</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49450;left:108"><nobr>after the other and immerse them in the hot water and then massage them both gently; as I did</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49471;left:108"><nobr>this, he would close his eyes and moan.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49512;left:108"><nobr>After half an hour, he would say, &quot;The water's gone cold,&quot; and then I had to lift his feet out, one</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49533;left:108"><nobr>at a time, from the bucket, and carry the bucket in to the toilet. The water in it was dark—dead</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49554;left:108"><nobr>hair and bits of skin floated on it. I had to fill the bucket with fresh hot water, and bring it back.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49595;left:108"><nobr>As I was massaging, the two sons pulled up chairs and sat down by their father to talk. Ram</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49616;left:108"><nobr>Persad would bring out a bottle full of a golden liquid, and pour it into three glasses, and drop ice</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49637;left:108"><nobr>cubes in their glasses, and hand one glass to each of them. The sons would wait for the father to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49654;left:108"><nobr>take the first sip and say, &quot;Ah…whiskey. How would we survive this country without it,&quot; and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49678;left:108"><nobr>then the talking would start. The more they talked, the faster I massaged. They talked about</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49699;left:108"><nobr>politics, coal, and about your country—China. Somehow these things—politics, coal, China—</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:49719;left:108"><nobr>were linked to the family fortunes of the Stork; and dimly I understood that my own fate, since I</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:53346;left:108"><nobr>house. She wore pants; I gaped. Who had ever seen a woman dressed in trousers before—except</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53366;left:108"><nobr>in the movies? I assumed at first she was an American, one of those magical things he had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:53387;left:108"><nobr>brought home from New York, like his accent and the fruit-flavored perfume he put on his face</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:53449;left:108"><nobr>Two days later, Ram Persad and the slanty-eyed Nepali were gossiping. I took a broom, began</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:56330;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I was born in Laxmangarh. But I haven't seen it since. Were you born there too?&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:56537;left:108"><nobr>He looked me up and down, from head to toe, the way I had been looking at him ever since I had</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:56599;left:108"><nobr>His eyes seemed full of wonder: how could two such contrasting specimens of humanity be</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:56661;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Well, I want to go there today,&quot; he said, getting up from the bed. &quot;I want to see my birthplace.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:56868;left:108"><nobr>The Stork had wanted to come along with us, and that would really make it a grand entry for me</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:56889;left:108"><nobr>into the village—but at the last minute he decided to stay back. In the end, it was just Mr. Ashok</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:56910;left:108"><nobr>and Pinky Madam whom I was taking in the Honda City, out into the countryside, toward</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:56972;left:108"><nobr>It was the first time I was driving the two of them—Ram Persad had had the privilege until now.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:56993;left:108"><nobr>I still wasn't used to the Honda City, which is a moody car with a mind of its own, as I've said. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57013;left:108"><nobr>just prayed to the gods—all of them—not to let me make a mistake.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:57352;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Why are we going to this place in the middle of nowhere, Ashoky?&quot; Her voice, breaking the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:57414;left:108"><nobr>&quot;It's my ancestral village, Pinky. Wouldn't you like to see it? I was born there—but Father sent</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57435;left:108"><nobr>me away as a boy. There was some trouble with the Communist guerrillas then. I thought we</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:57497;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Have you decided on a return date?&quot; she asked suddenly. &quot;I mean to New York.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57539;left:108"><nobr>&quot;No. Not yet. We'll get one soon.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57580;left:108"><nobr>He was silent for a minute; my ears were really wide open now. If they went back to America—</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57601;left:108"><nobr>would they no longer need a second driver in the home?</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57642;left:108"><nobr>She said nothing; but I swear, I could hear teeth gritting.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57684;left:108"><nobr>Mr. Ashok had no clue, though—he began humming a film song, until she said, &quot;What a fucking</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:57746;left:108"><nobr>&quot;What was that?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57787;left:108"><nobr>&quot;You lied about returning to America, didn't you, Ashok—you're never going back, are you?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57828;left:108"><nobr>&quot;There's a driver in the car, Pinky—I'll explain everything later.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57870;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Oh, what does he matter! He's only the driver. And you're just changing the topic again!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:57911;left:108"><nobr>A lovely fragrance filled the car—and I knew that she must have moved about and adjusted her</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:57974;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Why do we even need a driver? Why can't you drive, like you used to?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58015;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Pinky, that was New York—you can't drive in India, just look at this traffic. No one follows any</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58035;left:108"><nobr>rules—people run across the road like crazy—look—look at that—&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58077;left:108"><nobr>A tractor was coming down the road at full speed, belching out a nice thick plume of black diesel</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:58139;left:108"><nobr>&quot;It's on the wrong side of the road! The driver of that tractor hasn't even noticed!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58181;left:108"><nobr><i>I </i>hadn't noticed either. Well, I suppose you are meant to drive on the left side of the road, but</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:58830;left:108"><nobr>all. As soon as I saw him enter the mansion for lunch, I went to the kitchen and told the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58851;left:108"><nobr>caretaker, &quot;I love Mr. Ashok so much you must let me serve him lunch!&quot; The cook agreed—and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58872;left:108"><nobr>I got to take my first good look at the Wild Boar in years. He was older than I remembered, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58892;left:108"><nobr>more bent over, but his teeth were exactly the same: sharp and blackened and with two</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58913;left:108"><nobr>distinctive hooked ones curving up by the side. They ate in the dining room—a magnificent</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58934;left:108"><nobr>place, with high ceilings, heavy, old-fashioned furniture all around, and a huge chandelier.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:58975;left:108"><nobr>&quot;It's a lovely old mansion,&quot; Mr. Ashok said. &quot;Everything's gorgeous in here.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59016;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Except the chandelier—it's a bit tacky,&quot; she said.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59058;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Your father <i>loves </i>chandeliers,&quot; the Wild Boar said. &quot;He wanted to put one up in the bathroom</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59079;left:108"><nobr>here, did you know that? I'm serious!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59120;left:108"><nobr>When the caretaker brought out the dishes and put them on the table, Mr. Ashok looked at them</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59141;left:108"><nobr>and said, &quot;Don't you have anything vegetarian? I don't eat meat.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59182;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I've never heard of a landlord who was vegetarian,&quot; the Wild Boar said. &quot;It's not natural. You</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59203;left:108"><nobr>need meat to toughen you up.&quot; He opened his lips and showed his curved teeth.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59244;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I don't believe in killing animals needlessly. I knew vegetarians in America, and I think they're</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59265;left:108"><nobr>right.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59306;left:108"><nobr>&quot;What crazy ideas do you boys pick up?&quot; the old man said. &quot;You're a landlord. It's the Brahmins</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59327;left:108"><nobr>who are vegetarian, not us.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59369;left:108"><nobr>After lunch I washed the dishes; I helped the caretaker make tea. My master was taken care of;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:59389;left:108"><nobr>now it was time to see my family. I went out the mansion by the back door.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:59728;left:108"><nobr>Kishan raised his hand. I hadn't seen him since he left Dhanbad and came back home to work in</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:60018;left:108"><nobr>But they weren't really angry. For the first time I can remember, I got more attention than the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:60163;left:108"><nobr>They almost carried me on their backs to the old house, I tell you. The neighbors were waiting</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:60225;left:108"><nobr>I was shown the children that had been born in the family since I had left, and forced to kiss</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:60267;left:108"><nobr>wife, Leela, had had a child. The family was larger. The needs were more. I was chastised by all</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:60329;left:108"><nobr>Kusum beat her head with her fist; she wailed into the neighbors' house. &quot;My grandson has a job,</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:60432;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Yes,&quot; Kusum said. &quot;Yes, that's a good idea.&quot; She grinned, and rubbed her forearms. &quot;A very</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:60494;left:108"><nobr>Kishan had a lot of news for me—and since this was the Darkness, all of it was bad news. The</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:61144;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Granny,&quot; I said, looking at the large piece of red, curried meat, &quot;give me some more time. I'm</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:61682;left:108"><nobr>I left behind the temple, the market, the hogs, and the sewage. Then I was alone at the pond—the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61703;left:108"><nobr>Black Fort on the hill up in front of me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61745;left:108"><nobr>Near the water's edge I sat down, gnashing my teeth.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61786;left:108"><nobr>I couldn't stop thinking of Kishan's body. They were eating him alive in there! They would do</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:61807;left:108"><nobr>the same thing to him that they did to Father—scoop him out from the inside and leave him weak </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:62125;left:108"><nobr>There was a splashing noise. The water buffalo in the pond lifted its water-lily-covered head—it</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:62350;left:108"><nobr>You are familiar already with my love of poetry—and especially of the works of the four Muslim</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62371;left:108"><nobr>poets acknowledged to be the greatest of all time. Now, Iqbal, who is one of the four, has written</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62392;left:108"><nobr>this remarkable poem in which he imagines that he is the Devil, standing up for his rights at a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62413;left:108"><nobr>moment when God tries to bully him. The Devil, according to the Muslims, was once God's</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62433;left:108"><nobr>sidekick, until he fought with Him and went freelance, and ever since, there has been a war of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62454;left:108"><nobr>brains between God and the Devil. This is what Iqbal writes about. The exact words of the poem</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62475;left:108"><nobr>I can't remember, but it goes something like this.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62516;left:108"><nobr>God says: <i>I am powerful. I am huge. Become my servant again.</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62557;left:108"><nobr>Devil says: <i>Ha!</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62599;left:108"><nobr>When I remember Iqbal's Devil, as I do often, lying here under my chandelier, I think of a little</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62620;left:108"><nobr>black figure in a wet khaki uniform who is climbing up the entranceway to a black fort.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62661;left:108"><nobr>There he stands now, one foot on the ramparts of the Black Fort, surrounded by a group of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62682;left:108"><nobr>amazed monkeys.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62723;left:108"><nobr>Up in the blue skies, God spreads His palm over the plains below, showing this little man</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62744;left:108"><nobr>Laxmangarh, and its little tributary of the Ganga, and all that lies beyond: a million such villages,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62764;left:108"><nobr>a billion such people. And God asks this little man:</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62806;left:108"><nobr><i>Isn't it all wonderful? Isn't it all grand? Aren't you grateful to be my servant?</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62847;left:108"><nobr>And then I see this small black man in the wet khaki uniform start to shake, as if he has gone</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:62868;left:108"><nobr>mad with anger, before delivering to the Almighty a gesture of thanks for having created the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:63251;left:108"><nobr>Half an hour later, when I came down the hill, I went straight to the Stork's mansion. Mr. Ashok</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63271;left:108"><nobr>and Pinky Madam were waiting for me by the Honda City.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63313;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Where the hell have you been, driver?&quot; she yelled. &quot;We've been waiting.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63354;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Sorry, madam,&quot; I said, grinning to her. &quot;I'm very sorry.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63396;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Have a heart, Pinky. He was seeing his family. You know how close they are to their families in</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:63458;left:108"><nobr>Kusum, Luttu Auntie, and all the other women were gathered by the side of the road as we drove</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:63499;left:108"><nobr>gnarled fist at me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63541;left:108"><nobr>I put my foot down on the accelerator and drove right past all of them.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63582;left:108"><nobr>We went through the market square—I took a look at the tea shop: the human spiders were at</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63603;left:108"><nobr>work at the tables, the rickshaws were arranged in a line at the back, and the cyclist with the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63624;left:108"><nobr>poster for the daily pornographic film on the other side of the river had just begun his rounds.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63665;left:108"><nobr>I drove through the greenery, through the bushes and the trees and the water buffaloes lazing in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63686;left:108"><nobr>muddy ponds; past the creepers and the bushes; past the paddy fields; past the coconut palms;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63706;left:108"><nobr>past the bananas; past the neems and the banyans; past the wild grass with the faces of the water</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63727;left:108"><nobr>buffaloes peeping through. A small, half-naked boy was riding a buffalo by the side of the road;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63748;left:108"><nobr>when he saw us, he pumped his fists and shouted in joy—and I wanted to shout back at him: <i>Yes,</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63768;left:108"><nobr><i>I feel that way too! I'm never going back there!</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63810;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Can you talk now, Ashoky? Can you answer my question?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63851;left:108"><nobr>&quot;All right. Look, when I came back, I really thought it was going to be for two months, Pinky.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63868;left:108"><nobr>But…things have changed so much in India. There are so many more things I could do here than</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63893;left:108"><nobr>in New York now.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63934;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Ashoky, that's bullshit.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63975;left:108"><nobr>&quot;No, it's not. Really, it's not. The way things are changing in India now, this place is going to be</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:63996;left:108"><nobr>like America in ten years. Plus, I like it better here. We've got people to take care of us here—our</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:64017;left:108"><nobr>drivers, our watchmen, our masseurs. Where in New York will you find someone to bring you</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:64038;left:108"><nobr>tea and sweet biscuits while you're still lying in bed, the way Ram Bahadur does for us? You</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:64058;left:108"><nobr>know, he's been in my family for thirty years—we call him a servant, but he's part of the family.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:64079;left:108"><nobr>Dad found this Nepali wandering about Dhanbad one day with a gun in his hand and said—&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:64522;left:108"><nobr>My heart skipped a beat. I had no idea what I had just done. Mr. Ashok leaned forward and said,</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:64584;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:64625;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Didn't you see, Pinky—we just drove past a temple&quot;—Mr. Ashok pointed to the tall, conical</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:64708;left:108"><nobr>He touched me on the shoulder.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:64791;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Balram.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:64832;left:108"><nobr>&quot;So Balram here touched his eye as a mark of respect. The villagers are so religious in the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:64853;left:108"><nobr>Darkness.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:64894;left:108"><nobr>That seemed to have impressed the two of them, so I put my finger to my eye a moment later,</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:64956;left:108"><nobr>&quot;What's that for, driver? I don't see any temples around.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:64994;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Er…we drove past a sacred tree, sir. I was offering my respects.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65039;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Did you hear that? They worship nature. It's beautiful, isn't it?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65081;left:108"><nobr>The two of them kept an eye open for every tree or temple we passed by, and turned to me for a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65102;left:108"><nobr>reaction of piety—which I gave them, of course, and with growing elaborateness: first just</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65122;left:108"><nobr>touching my eye, then my neck, then my clavicle, and even my nipples.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65163;left:108"><nobr>They were convinced I was the most religious servant on earth. (Take <i>that, </i>Ram Persad!)</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65205;left:108"><nobr>Our way back into Dhanbad was blocked. There was a truck parked on the road. It was full of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65226;left:108"><nobr>men with red headbands shouting slogans.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65267;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Rise against the rich! Support the Great Socialist. Keep the landlords out!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65309;left:108"><nobr>Soon another set of trucks drove by: the men in them wore green headbands and shouted at the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65329;left:108"><nobr>men in the other truck. A fight was about to break out.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:65371;left:108"><nobr>&quot;What's going on?&quot; Pinky Madam asked in an alarmed tone of voice. </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:67539;left:108"><nobr>the Darkness. Some of the customers at the tea shop said the Great Socialist started off as a good</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67560;left:108"><nobr>man. He had come to clean things up, but the mud of Mother Ganga had sucked him in. Others</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67581;left:108"><nobr>said he was dirty from the start, but he had just fooled everyone and only now did we see him for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67602;left:108"><nobr>what he was. Whatever the case was, no one seemed able to vote him out of power. He had ruled</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67622;left:108"><nobr>the Darkness, winning election after election, but now his rule was weakening.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67664;left:108"><nobr>You see, a total of ninety-three criminal cases—for murder, rape, grand larceny, gun-running,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67685;left:108"><nobr>pimping, and many other such minor offenses—are pending against the Great Socialist and his</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67705;left:108"><nobr>ministers at the present moment. Not easy to get convictions when the judges are judging in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67726;left:108"><nobr>Darkness, yet three convictions have been delivered, and three of the ministers are currently in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:67747;left:108"><nobr>jail but continue to be ministers. The Great Socialist himself is said to have embezzled one </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:68127;left:108"><nobr>no say in. The Great Socialist's enemies seemed to be stronger this election than at the last one.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:68148;left:108"><nobr>They had made pamphlets, and went about on buses and trucks with microphones, and</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:68541;left:108"><nobr>knew about this—but this year something had gone wrong with the deal, so the four Animals had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:68562;left:108"><nobr>joined together and started a party of their own.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:68603;left:108"><nobr>And below the slogan the policeman wrote:</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:68666;left:108"><nobr>(LENINIST FACTION)</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:68707;left:108"><nobr>Which was the name of the landlords' party.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:68748;left:108"><nobr>In the weeks before the elections, trucks bumped up and down the dirty street of Laxmangarh,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:68769;left:108"><nobr>full of young men holding microphones: &quot;Stand up to the rich!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:68810;left:108"><nobr>Vijay, the bus conductor, was always on one of these trucks. He had quit his old job and joined</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:68852;left:108"><nobr>himself. He was a born politician. He wore a red headband to show that he was one of the Great</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:68873;left:108"><nobr>Socialist's supporters, and made speeches every morning in front of the tea shop. The landlords</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:68893;left:108"><nobr>brought in trucks full of their own supporters in retaliation. And from these trucks men shouted</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:69253;left:108"><nobr>The Animals' bluff had worked. The Great Socialist had agreed to cut a deal with them.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69294;left:108"><nobr>Vijay bowed down and touched the feet of the Stork at a big rally in front of the tea shop. It</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69315;left:108"><nobr>seemed that all differences had been patched, and the Stork had been named the president of the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:69460;left:108"><nobr>Lots of dust and policemen came into the village next morning. One officer read out voting</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:69564;left:108"><nobr>and put those shackles back on our hands that he, the Great Socialist, had so lovingly taken off</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69584;left:108"><nobr>our hands. Did we understand? And then, in a cloud of dust, the police drove off.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69626;left:108"><nobr>&quot;It's the way it always is,&quot; my father told me that night. &quot;I've seen twelve elections—five general,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69646;left:108"><nobr>five state, two local—and someone else has voted for me twelve times. I've heard that people in</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:69708;left:108"><nobr>On the day of the election, one man went mad.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69750;left:108"><nobr>This happens every time, at every election in the Darkness.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69791;left:108"><nobr>One of my father's colleagues, a small dark-skinned man whom no one had taken any notice of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69812;left:108"><nobr>until now, was surrounded by a mob of rickshaw-pullers, including my father. They were trying</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69833;left:108"><nobr>to dissuade him, but only halfheartedly.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69874;left:108"><nobr>They had seen this thing happening before. They wouldn't be able to stop this man now.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69915;left:108"><nobr>Every now and then, even in a place like Laxmangarh, a ray of sunlight will break through. All</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69936;left:108"><nobr>these posters and speeches and slogans on the wall, maybe they get into a man's head. He</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69957;left:108"><nobr>declares himself a citizen of the democracy of India and he wants to cast his vote. That was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:69978;left:108"><nobr>where this rickshaw-puller had got to. He declared himself free of the Darkness: he had made his</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:70040;left:108"><nobr>He began walking straight to the voting booth at the school. &quot;I'm supposed to stand up to the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:70102;left:108"><nobr>When he got there, the Great Socialist's supporters had already put up the tally of votes outside</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:73045;left:108"><nobr>When I came back with the spittoon, he coolly turned to the Mongoose and said, &quot;Son, won't you</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73065;left:108"><nobr>hold the spittoon for me?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73107;left:108"><nobr>The Mongoose refused to move, so the Great Socialist took the spittoon from my hands and held</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73128;left:108"><nobr>it out.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73169;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Take it, son.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73210;left:108"><nobr>The Mongoose took it.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73252;left:108"><nobr>Then the Great Socialist spat into the spittoon, three times.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73293;left:108"><nobr>The Mongoose's hands trembled; his face turned black with shame.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73335;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Thank you for that, son,&quot; the Great Socialist said, wiping his lips. He turned to me and tickled</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73355;left:108"><nobr>his forehead. &quot;Where was I, now?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73397;left:108"><nobr>There you have it. That was the positive side of the Great Socialist. He humiliated all our</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73418;left:108"><nobr>masters—that's why we kept voting him back in.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73459;left:108"><nobr>That night, on the pretext again of sweeping the courtyard, I got close to the Stork and his sons;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73479;left:108"><nobr>they were sitting on a bench, holding glasses of golden liquor and talking. Mukesh Sir had just</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73500;left:108"><nobr>finished; the old man shook his head.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73542;left:108"><nobr>&quot;We can't do that, Mukesh. We need him.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73583;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I'm telling you, Father. We don't anymore. We can go straight to Delhi. We know people there</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73604;left:108"><nobr>now.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73645;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I agree with Mukesh, Father. We shouldn't let him treat us like this anymore—like we're his</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73666;left:108"><nobr>slaves.&quot; </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:73943;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Quiet, Ashok. Let Mukesh and me discuss this.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:73984;left:108"><nobr>I swept the courtyard twice over, and listened. Then I began tightening Pinky Madam's sagging</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:74046;left:108"><nobr>But a pair of suspicious Nepali eyes spotted me out: &quot;Don't loiter in the courtyard. Go and sit in</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:74253;left:108"><nobr>Ram Bahadur came up to me, and said, &quot;Have you ever been to Delhi?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74295;left:108"><nobr>I shook my head.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74336;left:108"><nobr>&quot;They're going to Delhi in a week. Mr. Ashok and Pinky Madam. They're going to leave for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74357;left:108"><nobr>three months.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74398;left:108"><nobr>I got down on my knees and directed the blow dryer under Cuddles's legs, pretending not to be</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74419;left:108"><nobr>interested, and asked, as casually as I could, &quot;Why?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74460;left:108"><nobr>The Nepali shrugged. Who knew? We were just servants. One thing, though, he did know.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74502;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Only one driver will be taken along. And this driver will get three thousand rupees a month—</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74523;left:108"><nobr>that's how much they'll pay him in Delhi.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74564;left:108"><nobr>The blow dryer fell out of my hand. &quot;Serious? Three thousand?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74606;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Yes.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74647;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Will they take me along, sir?&quot; I got up and asked pleadingly, &quot;Can't you make them take me?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74688;left:108"><nobr>&quot;They'll take Ram Persad,&quot; he said with a sneer of his Nepali lips. &quot;Unless…&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74730;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Unless?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74771;left:108"><nobr>He minted coins with his fingers.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74813;left:108"><nobr>Five thousand rupees—and he would tell the Stork that I was the man to be taken along to Delhi.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:74854;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Five thousand—where will I get such money? My family steals my whole paycheck!&quot; </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:75315;left:108"><nobr>Ram Persad was up. He was sitting on his bed, chopping onions on a wooden board: I heard the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:75377;left:108"><nobr><i>What the hell is he chopping onions so early for? </i>I thought, turning to a side and closing my eyes</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:75439;left:108"><nobr><i>This man has a secret.</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:75481;left:108"><nobr>I stayed awake, while the man on the bed chopped onions. I tried to figure it out.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:75522;left:108"><nobr>What had I noticed about Ram Persad in the past few days?</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:75563;left:108"><nobr>For one thing, his breath had gone bad. Even Pinky Madam complained. He had suddenly</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:75584;left:108"><nobr>stopped eating with us, either inside the house or outside. Even on Sundays, when there would be</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:75605;left:108"><nobr>chicken, Ram Persad would refuse to eat with us, saying he had already done so, or he wasn't</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:75625;left:108"><nobr>hungry, or…</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:75667;left:108"><nobr>The chopping of the onions continued, and I kept adding thought to thought in the dark.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:75708;left:108"><nobr>I watched him all day. Toward evening, as I was expecting, he began moving to the gate.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:75750;left:108"><nobr>From my conversation with the cook, I had learned that Ram Persad had started to head out of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:75770;left:108"><nobr>the house at the same time every evening. I followed at a distance. He went into a part of the city</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:75791;left:108"><nobr>I had never seen before, and walked around a few alleys. At one point I distinctly saw him turn</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:75812;left:108"><nobr>around, as if to make sure no one was following him; then he darted.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:75853;left:108"><nobr>He had stopped in front of a two-story building. The wall had a large metal grille divided into</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:75874;left:108"><nobr>square units; a series of small black taps jutted out from the wall below the grille. He bent down</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:75895;left:108"><nobr>to a tap, washed his face and gargled and spat. Then he took off his sandals. Shoes and sandals</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:75915;left:108"><nobr>had been folded and stuffed into the squares of the grille—he did the same with his sandals. Then</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:75936;left:108"><nobr>he went into the building and closed the door.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:75978;left:108"><nobr>I slapped my forehead.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76019;left:108"><nobr>What a fool I'd been! &quot;It's Ramadan! They can't eat and drink during the day.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76060;left:108"><nobr>I ran back to the house and found the Nepali. He was standing at the gate, rubbing his teeth with</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76081;left:108"><nobr>a twig broken from a neem tree—which is what many poor people in my country do, Mr. </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:76443;left:108"><nobr>&quot;A great film, sir. Lots of dancing. Hero was a Muslim. Name of Mohammad Mohammad.&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:76526;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Now, this Mohammad Mohammad was a poor, honest, hardworking Muslim, but he wanted a</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:76567;left:108"><nobr>feed his starving family, he claimed to be a Hindu! And took the name of Ram Persad.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76609;left:108"><nobr>The twig fell out of the Nepali's mouth.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76650;left:108"><nobr>&quot;And you know how he managed to pull this off? Because the Nepali guard at this house, whom</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76671;left:108"><nobr>the masters trusted absolutely, and who was supposed to check up on Ram Persad's background,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76692;left:108"><nobr>was <i>in </i>on the scam!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76733;left:108"><nobr>Before he could run, I caught him by the collar. Technically, in these servant-versus-servant</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76754;left:108"><nobr>affairs, that is all you need to do to indicate: &quot;I have won.&quot; But if you're going to do these things,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76774;left:108"><nobr>it's better to do them in style, right? So I slapped him too.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76816;left:108"><nobr>I was servant number one from now on in this household.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76857;left:108"><nobr>I ran back to the mosque. <i>Namaz </i>must have ended by now. And indeed, Ram Persad—or</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76878;left:108"><nobr>Mohammad or whatever his name really was—came out of the mosque, took his sandals down</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76899;left:108"><nobr>from the window, slapped them on the ground, wriggled his feet into them, and began walking</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76919;left:108"><nobr>out. He saw me—I winked at him—and he knew that the game was up.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:76961;left:108"><nobr>I did the needful in a few precise words.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77002;left:108"><nobr>Then I went back to the house. The Nepali was watching me from behind the black bars. I took</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77023;left:108"><nobr>his key chain from him and put it in my pocket. &quot;Get me some tea. And biscuits.&quot; I pinched his</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77043;left:108"><nobr>shirt. &quot;And I want your uniform too. Mine is getting old.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77085;left:108"><nobr>I slept in the bed that night.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77126;left:108"><nobr>In the morning someone came into the room. It was ex–driver number one. Without a word to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77147;left:108"><nobr>me, he began packing. All his things fitted into one small bag.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77189;left:108"><nobr>I thought, <i>What a miserable life he's had, having to hide his religion, his name, just to get a job</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77209;left:108"><nobr><i>as a driver—and he is a good driver, no question of it, a far better one than I will ever be. </i>Part of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:77230;left:108"><nobr>me wanted to get up and apologize to him right there and say, <i>You go and be a driver in Delhi.</i></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:77631;left:108"><nobr>In the evening, the Nepali came to me with a grin on his face—the same fake servant's grin he</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:77880;left:108"><nobr>From then on, every morning, it was hot Nepali tea, and some nice sugar biscuits, on a porcelain</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:77942;left:108"><nobr>Kishan came to the gate that Sunday and heard the news from me. I thought he was going to</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:77983;left:108"><nobr>eyes were full of tears. Someone in his family was going to make it out of the Darkness and into</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:78045;left:108"><nobr>&quot;It's just like our mother always said. She knew you were going to make it.&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:78128;left:108"><nobr>and jeeps all along the road—and they were bursting with passengers who packed the insides,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:78149;left:108"><nobr>and hung out the doors, and even got on the roofs. They were all headed from the Darkness to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:78170;left:108"><nobr>Delhi. You'd think the whole world was migrating.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:78211;left:108"><nobr>Each time we passed by one of these buses, I had to grin; I wished I could roll down the window</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:78231;left:108"><nobr>and yell at them, <i>I'm going to Delhi in a </i>car—<i>an </i>air-conditioned <i>car!</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:78273;left:108"><nobr>But I'm sure they saw the words in my eyes.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:78356;left:108"><nobr>From the start, sir, there was a way in which I could understand what he wanted to say, the way</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:78377;left:108"><nobr>dogs understand their masters. I stopped the car, and then moved to my left, and he moved to his</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:78397;left:108"><nobr>right, and our bodies passed each other (so close that the stubble on his face scraped my cheeks</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:78418;left:108"><nobr>like the shaving brush that I use every morning, and the cologne from his skin—a lovely, rich,</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:79068;left:108"><nobr>It is not yet three, I could go on a little while longer. But I want to stop, because from here on I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79088;left:108"><nobr>have to tell you a new kind of story.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79130;left:108"><nobr>Remember, Mr. Premier, the first time, perhaps as a boy, when you opened the hood of a car and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79150;left:108"><nobr>looked into its entrails? Remember the colored wires twisting from one part of the engine to the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79171;left:108"><nobr>other, the black box full of yellow caps, enigmatic tubes hissing out steam and oil and grease</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79192;left:108"><nobr>everywhere—remember how mysterious and magical everything seemed? When I peer into the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79212;left:108"><nobr>portion of my story that unfolds in New Delhi, I feel the same way. If you ask me to explain how</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79233;left:108"><nobr>one event connects to another, or how one motive strengthens or weakens the next, or how I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79254;left:108"><nobr>went from thinking <i>this </i>about my master to thinking <i>that</i>—I will tell you that I myself don't</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79275;left:108"><nobr>understand these things. I cannot be certain that the story, as I will tell it, is the right story to tell.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79295;left:108"><nobr>I cannot be certain that I know exactly why Mr. Ashok died.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79337;left:108"><nobr>It will be good for me to stop here.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79378;left:108"><nobr>When we meet again, at midnight, remind me to turn the chandelier up a bit. The story gets much</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79399;left:108"><nobr>darker from here.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79462;left:391"><nobr><b>The Fourth Night</b></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79500;left:108"><nobr>I should talk a little more about this chandelier.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79542;left:108"><nobr>Why not? I've got no family anymore. All I've got is chandeliers.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79583;left:108"><nobr>I have a chandelier here, above my head in my office, and then I have two in my apartment in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79603;left:108"><nobr>Raj Mahal Villas Phase Two. One in the drawing room, and a small one in the toilet too. It must</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79624;left:108"><nobr>be the only toilet in Bangalore with a chandelier! </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:79883;left:108"><nobr>I saw all these chandeliers one day, tied to the branch of a big banyan tree near Lalbagh Gardens;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79903;left:108"><nobr>a boy from a village was selling them, and I bought all of them on the spot. I paid some fellow</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79924;left:108"><nobr>with a bullock cart to bring them home and we went riding through Bangalore, me and this</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79945;left:108"><nobr>fellow and four chandeliers, on a limousine powered by bulls!</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:79986;left:108"><nobr>It makes me happy to see a chandelier. Why not, I'm a free man, let me buy all the chandeliers I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80007;left:108"><nobr>want. For one thing, they keep the lizards away from this room. It's the truth, sir. Lizards don't</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80028;left:108"><nobr>like the light, so as soon as they see a chandelier, they stay away.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80069;left:108"><nobr>I don't understand why other people don't buy chandeliers all the time, and put them up</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80090;left:108"><nobr>everywhere. Free people don't know the value of freedom, that's the problem.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80131;left:108"><nobr>Sometimes, in my apartment, I turn on both chandeliers, and then I lie down amid all that light,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80152;left:108"><nobr>and I just start laughing. A man in hiding, and yet he's surrounded by chandeliers!</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80193;left:108"><nobr>There—I'm revealing the secret to a successful escape. The police searched for me in darkness:</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80214;left:108"><nobr>but I hid myself in light.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80256;left:108"><nobr>In Bangalore!</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80297;left:108"><nobr>Now, among the many uses of a chandelier, this most unsung and unloved object, is that, when</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80318;left:108"><nobr>you forget something, all you have to do is stare at the glass pieces shining in the ceiling long</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80338;left:108"><nobr>enough, and within five minutes you'll remember exactly what it is you were trying to remember.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80380;left:108"><nobr>See, I'd forgotten where we left off the story last night, so I had to go on about chandeliers for a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80400;left:108"><nobr>while, keeping you busy, but now I remember where we were.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80442;left:108"><nobr>Delhi—we had got to Delhi last night when I stopped the narrative.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80483;left:108"><nobr>The capital of our glorious nation. The seat of Parliament, of the president, of all ministers and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80504;left:108"><nobr>prime ministers. The pride of our civic planning. The showcase of the republic.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80546;left:108"><nobr>That's what <i>they </i>call it.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80587;left:108"><nobr>Let a driver tell you the truth. And the truth is that Delhi is a crazy city.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80628;left:108"><nobr>See, the rich people live in big housing colonies like Defence Colony or Greater Kailash or</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80649;left:108"><nobr>Vasant Kunj, and inside their colonies the houses have numbers and letters, but this numbering</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80670;left:108"><nobr>and lettering system follows no known system of logic. For instance, in the English alphabet, A</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80690;left:108"><nobr>is next to B, which everyone knows, even people like me who don't know English. But in a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80711;left:108"><nobr>colony, one house is called A 231, and then the next is F 378. So one time Pinky Madam wanted</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80732;left:108"><nobr>me to take her to Greater Kailash E 231, I tracked down the houses to E 200, and just when I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80753;left:108"><nobr>thought we were almost there, E Block vanished completely. The next house was S something.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:80794;left:108"><nobr>Pinky Madam began yelling. &quot;I told you not to bring this hick from the village!&quot; </nobr></div>
</span></font>

<div style="position:absolute;top:80959;left:0"><hr><table border=0 width=100%><tr><td bgcolor=eeeeee align=right><font face=arial,sans-serif><a name=69><b>Page 69</b></a></font></td></tr></table></div><font size=3 face="Times"><span style="font-size:16px;font-family:Times">
<div style="position:absolute;top:81071;left:108"><nobr>And then another thing. Every road in Delhi has a name, like Aurangazeb Road, or Humayun</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81091;left:108"><nobr>Road, or Archbishop Makarios Road. And no one, masters or servants, knows the name of the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81112;left:108"><nobr>road. You ask someone, &quot;Where's Nikolai Copernicus Marg?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81154;left:108"><nobr>And he could be a man who lived on Nikolai Copernicus Marg his whole life, and he'll open his</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81174;left:108"><nobr>mouth and say, &quot;<i>Hahn?</i>&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81216;left:108"><nobr>Or he'll say, &quot;Straight ahead, then turn left,&quot; even though he has no idea.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81257;left:108"><nobr>And all the roads look the same, all of them go around and around grassy circles in which men</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81278;left:108"><nobr>are sleeping or eating or playing cards, and then four roads shoot off from that grassy circle, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81299;left:108"><nobr>then you go down one road, and you hit another grassy circle where men are sleeping or playing</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81319;left:108"><nobr>cards, and then four more roads go off from it. So you just keep getting lost, and lost, and lost in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81340;left:108"><nobr>Delhi.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81381;left:108"><nobr>Thousands of people live on the sides of the road in Delhi. They have come from the Darkness</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81402;left:108"><nobr>too—you can tell by their thin bodies, filthy faces, by the animal-like way they live under the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81423;left:108"><nobr>huge bridges and overpasses, making fires and washing and taking lice out of their hair while the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81444;left:108"><nobr>cars roar past them. These homeless people are a particular problem for drivers. They never wait</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81464;left:108"><nobr>for a red light—simply dashing across the road on impulse. And each time I braked to avoid</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81485;left:108"><nobr>slamming the car into one of them, the shouting would start from the passenger's seat.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81526;left:108"><nobr>But I ask you, who built Delhi in this crazy way? Which geniuses were responsible for making F</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81547;left:108"><nobr>Block come after A Block and House Number 69 come after House Number 12? Who was so</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81568;left:108"><nobr>busy partying and drinking English liquor and taking their Pomeranian dogs for walks and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81588;left:108"><nobr>shampoos that they gave the roads names that no one could remember?</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81630;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Are you lost again, driver?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81671;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Don't go after him again.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81713;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Why do you always defend him, Ashok?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81754;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Don't we have more serious things to discuss? Why are we always talking about this driver?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81795;left:108"><nobr>&quot;All right, let's discuss the other things, then. First let's discuss your wife, and her temper</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81816;left:108"><nobr>tantrums.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81858;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Do you really think that's more important than the tax thing? I keep asking you what are we</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81878;left:108"><nobr>doing about it, and you keep changing the topic. I think it's <i>insane, </i>how much they're asking us</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81899;left:108"><nobr>to pay.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81941;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I told you. It's a political thing. They're harassing us because Father is trying to distance himself</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:81961;left:108"><nobr>from the Great Socialist.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:82003;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I don't know why he ever got involved with that rogue.&quot; </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:82590;left:108"><nobr>He sighed and fell back on his seat. &quot;We shouldn't have brought him here, he's hopeless. Ram</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:82611;left:108"><nobr>Bahadur got it all wrong about this fellow. Ashok.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:82652;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Hm?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:82694;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Look up from your phone a minute. Have you told Pinky that you're staying back for good?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:82735;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Hm. Yes.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:82776;left:108"><nobr>&quot;What does the Queen say?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:82818;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Don't call her that. She's your sister-in-law, Mukesh. She'll be happy in Gurgaon, it's the most</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:82839;left:108"><nobr>American part of the city.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:82880;left:108"><nobr>Now, Mr. Ashok's thinking was smart. Ten years ago, they say, there was nothing in Gurgaon,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:82901;left:108"><nobr>just water buffaloes and fat Punjabi farmers. Today it's the <i>modernest </i>suburb of Delhi. American</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:82922;left:108"><nobr>Express, Microsoft, all the big American companies have offices there. The main road is full of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:82942;left:108"><nobr>shopping malls—each mall has a cinema inside! So if Pinky Madam missed America, this was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:82963;left:108"><nobr>the best place to bring her.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:83004;left:108"><nobr>&quot;This moron,&quot; the Mongoose said, &quot;see what he's done. He's got lost again.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:83046;left:108"><nobr>He stretched his hand and smacked my skull with it. &quot;Take a left from the fountain, you idiot!</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:83488;left:108"><nobr>The Mongoose switched to English—and I didn't catch what he said—but Mr. Ashok replied in</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:83633;left:108"><nobr>Pity.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:83675;left:441"><nobr>* * *</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:83714;left:108"><nobr>&quot;How much are they paying you, Country-Mouse?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:83755;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Enough. I'm happy.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:83797;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Not telling me, eh, Country-Mouse? Good boy. A loyal servant to the end. Liking Delhi?&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:83879;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Ha! Don't lie to me, sister-fucker. I know you're completely lost here. You must hate it!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:83921;left:108"><nobr>He tried to put his hand on me, and I squirmed and moved back. He had a skin disease—vitiligo</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:83941;left:108"><nobr>had turned his lips bright pink in the middle of a pitch-black face. I'd better explain about this</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:83962;left:108"><nobr>skin disease, which afflicts so many poor people in our country. I don't know why you get it, but</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:83983;left:108"><nobr>once you do, your skin changes color from brown to pink. Nine cases out of ten, it's a few bright</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:84004;left:108"><nobr>pink spots on a boy's nose or cheeks like a star exploding on his face, or a rash of pink on the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:84024;left:108"><nobr>forearm like someone burned him with boiling water there, but sometimes a fellow's whole body</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:84045;left:108"><nobr>has changed color, and as you walk past, you think, <i>An American! </i>You stop to gape; you want to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:84066;left:108"><nobr>go near and touch. Then you realize it's just one of ours, with that horrible condition.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:84107;left:108"><nobr>In the case of this driver, since the flash of pink had completely discolored his lips—and nothing</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:84128;left:108"><nobr>else—he looked like a clown at the circus with painted lips. My stomach churned just to see his</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:84148;left:108"><nobr>face. Still, he was the only one of the drivers who was being nice to me, so I stayed close to him.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:84190;left:108"><nobr>We were outside the mall. We—a dozen or so chauffeurs—were waiting for our masters to finish</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:84211;left:108"><nobr>their shopping. We weren't allowed inside the mall, of course—no one had to tell us these things.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:84231;left:108"><nobr>We had made a ring by the side of the parking lot, and we were smoking and chatting—every</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:84252;left:108"><nobr>now and then someone would emit a red jet of <i>paan </i>from his mouth.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:84294;left:108"><nobr>On account of the fact that he too was from the Darkness—he had of course guessed my origin at</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:84314;left:108"><nobr>once—the driver with the diseased lips gave me a course on how to survive Delhi and make sure</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:84925;left:108"><nobr><i>MURDER WEEKLY</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:84945;left:108"><nobr>RUPEES 4.50</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:84966;left:108"><nobr>EXCLUSIVE TRUE STORY:</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:84987;left:108"><nobr>&quot;A GOOD BODY NEVER GOES TO WASTE&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:85008;left:108"><nobr>MURDER. RAPE. REVENGE.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:85049;left:108"><nobr>Now I have to tell you about this magazine, <i>Murder Weekly, </i>since our prime minister certainly</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:85070;left:108"><nobr>won't tell you anything about it. It's sold in every newsstand in the city, alongside the cheap</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:85090;left:108"><nobr>novels, and it is very popular reading among all the servants of the city—whether they be cooks,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:85111;left:108"><nobr>children's maids, or gardeners. Drivers are no different. Every week when this magazine comes</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:85132;left:108"><nobr>out, with a cover image of a woman cowering from her would-be murderer, some driver has</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:85152;left:108"><nobr>bought the magazine and is passing it around to the other drivers.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:85194;left:108"><nobr>Now, don't panic at this information, Mr. Premier—no beads of chill sweat need form on your</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:85215;left:108"><nobr>yellow brow. Just because drivers and cooks in Delhi are reading <i>Murder Weekly, </i>it doesn't mean</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:85235;left:108"><nobr>that they are all about to slit their masters' necks. Of course, they'd <i>like </i>to. Of course, a billion</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:85256;left:108"><nobr>servants are secretly fantasizing about strangling their bosses—and that's why the government of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:85277;left:108"><nobr>India publishes this magazine and sells it on the streets for just four and a half rupees so that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:85298;left:108"><nobr>even the poor can buy it. You see, the murderer in the magazine is so mentally disturbed and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:85318;left:108"><nobr>sexually deranged that not one reader would want to be like him—and in the end he always gets</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:85339;left:108"><nobr>caught by some honest, hardworking police officer (ha!), or goes mad and hangs himself by a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:85359;left:108"><nobr>bedsheet after writing a sentimental letter to his mother or primary school teacher, or is chased,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:85380;left:108"><nobr>beaten, buggered, and garroted by the brother of the woman he has done in. So if your driver is</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:85401;left:108"><nobr>busy flicking through the pages of <i>Murder Weekly, </i>relax. No danger to you. Quite the contrary.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:85442;left:108"><nobr>It's when your driver starts to read about Gandhi and the Buddha that it's time to wet your pants,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:85463;left:108"><nobr>Mr. Jiabao.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:85505;left:108"><nobr>After showing it to me, Vitiligo-Lips closed the magazine and threw it into the circle where the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:85525;left:108"><nobr>other drivers were sitting; they made a grab for it, like a bunch of dogs rushing after a bone. He</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:86320;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Does your boss like foreign wine? I have a friend who works at a foreign embassy as a driver.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:86340;left:108"><nobr>He's got contacts there. You know the foreign-wine foreign-embassy scam?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:86382;left:108"><nobr>I shook my head.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:86423;left:108"><nobr>&quot;The scam is this, Country-Mouse. Foreign wine is very expensive in Delhi, because it's taxed.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:86444;left:108"><nobr>But the embassies get it in for free. They're supposed to drink their wine, but they sell it on the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:86465;left:108"><nobr>black market. I can get him other stuff too. Does he want golf balls? I've got people in the U.S.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:86486;left:108"><nobr>Consulate who will sell me that. Does he want women? I can get that too. If he's into boys, no</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:86506;left:108"><nobr>problem.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:86547;left:108"><nobr>&quot;My master doesn't do these things. He's a good man.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:86589;left:108"><nobr>The diseased lips opened up into a smile. &quot;Aren't they all?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:86630;left:108"><nobr>He began whistling some Hindi film song. One of the drivers had begun reading out a story from</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:86651;left:108"><nobr>the magazine; all the others had gone silent. I looked at the mall for a while.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:86693;left:108"><nobr>I turned to the driver with the horrible pink lips and said, &quot;I've got a question to ask you.&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:87073;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Right.&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:87177;left:108"><nobr>&quot;That's not a mall, Country-Mouse. That's an office building. They make calls from there to</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:87404;left:108"><nobr>He winked at me. &quot;What else, Country-Mouse? You're a curious fellow.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:87446;left:108"><nobr>I pointed to one of the girls coming out of the mall.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:87487;left:108"><nobr>&quot;What about her, Country-Mouse? You like her?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:87528;left:108"><nobr>I blushed. &quot;Tell me,&quot; I said, &quot;don't the women in cities—like her—have hair in their armpits and</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:87630;left:108"><nobr>After half an hour, Mukesh Sir and Mr. Ashok and Pinky Madam came out of the mall with</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:87650;left:108"><nobr>shopping bags; I ran ahead to take their bags from them, and put them in the back of the car, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:87671;left:108"><nobr>then closed the back and jumped into the driver's seat of the Honda City and drove them to their</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:87692;left:108"><nobr>new home, which was up on the thirteenth floor of a gigantic apartment building. The name of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:87712;left:108"><nobr>the apartment building was Buckingham Towers B Block. It was next to another huge apartment</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:87733;left:108"><nobr>building, built by the same housing company, which was Buckingham Towers A Block. Next to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:87754;left:108"><nobr>that was Windsor Manor A Block. And there were apartment blocks like this, all shiny and new,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:87775;left:108"><nobr>and with nice big English names, as far as the eye could see. Buckingham Towers B Block was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:87795;left:108"><nobr>one of the best—it had a nice big lobby, and an elevator in the lobby that all of us took up to the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:87816;left:108"><nobr>thirteenth floor.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:87858;left:108"><nobr>Personally, I didn't like the apartment much—the whole place was the size of the kitchen in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:87878;left:108"><nobr>Dhanbad. There were nice, soft, white sofas inside, and on the wall above the sofas, a giant</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:87899;left:108"><nobr>framed photo of Cuddles and Puddles. The Stork had not allowed them to come with us to the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:87919;left:108"><nobr>city.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:88344;left:108"><nobr>After putting the bags down, I went into the kitchen to see if any cleaning needed to be done—</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:88365;left:108"><nobr>there was a servant just to take care of the apartment, but he was a sloppy fellow, and as I said,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:88385;left:108"><nobr>they didn't really have a &quot;driver,&quot; just a servant who drove the car sometimes. I knew without</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:88406;left:108"><nobr>being told I also had to take care of the apartment. Any cleaning there was to be done, I would</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:88427;left:108"><nobr>do, and then come back and wait near the door with folded hands until Mukesh Sir said, &quot;You</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:88447;left:108"><nobr>can go now. And be ready at eight a.m. No hanky-panky just because you're in the city,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:88468;left:108"><nobr>understand?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:88509;left:108"><nobr>Then I went down the elevator, got out of the building, and went down the stairs to the servants'</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:88530;left:108"><nobr>quarters in the basement.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:88572;left:108"><nobr>I don't know how buildings are designed in your country, but in India every apartment block,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:88592;left:108"><nobr>every house, every hotel is built with a servants' quarters—sometimes at the back, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:88613;left:108"><nobr>sometimes (as in the case of Buckingham Towers B Block) underground—a warren of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:88634;left:108"><nobr>interconnected rooms where all the drivers, cooks, sweepers, maids, and chefs of the apartment</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:88654;left:108"><nobr>block can rest, sleep, and wait. When our masters wanted us, an electric bell began to ring</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:88675;left:108"><nobr>throughout the quarters—we would rush to a board and find a red light flashing next to the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:88696;left:108"><nobr>number of the apartment whose servant was needed upstairs.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:88737;left:108"><nobr>I walked down two flights of stairs and pushed open the door to the servants' quarters.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:88779;left:108"><nobr>The moment I got there, the other servants screamed—they yelled—they howled with laughter.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:88820;left:108"><nobr>The vitiligo-lipped driver was sitting with them, howling the hardest. He had told them the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:88841;left:108"><nobr>question I had asked him. They could not get over their amusement; each one of them had to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:88862;left:108"><nobr>come up to me, and force his fingers through my hair, and call me a &quot;village idiot,&quot; and slap me</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:88882;left:108"><nobr>on the back too.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:88923;left:108"><nobr>Servants need to abuse other servants. It's been bred into us, the way Alsatian dogs are bred to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:88944;left:108"><nobr>attack strangers. We attack anyone who's familiar.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:88986;left:108"><nobr>There and then I resolved never again to tell anyone in Delhi <i>anything </i>I was thinking. Especially</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:89048;left:108"><nobr>They kept teasing all evening long, and even at night, when we all went to the dormitory to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:89069;left:108"><nobr>sleep. Something about my face, my nose, my teeth, I don't know, it got on their nerves. They</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:89089;left:108"><nobr>even teased me about my uniform. See, in cities the drivers do not wear uniforms. They said I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:89110;left:108"><nobr>looked like a monkey in that uniform. So I changed into a dirty shirt and trousers like the rest of</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:89697;left:108"><nobr>why the mosquito net had been left there. Noises woke me up. The wall was covered with</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:89718;left:108"><nobr>cockroaches, which had come to feed on the minerals or the limestone in the plaster; their</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:89739;left:108"><nobr>chewing made a continuous noise, and their antennae trembled from every spot on the wall.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:89760;left:108"><nobr>Some of the cockroaches landed on top of the net; from inside, I could see their dark bodies</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:89780;left:108"><nobr>against its white weave. I folded in the fiber of the net and crushed one of them. The other</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:89801;left:108"><nobr>roaches took no notice of this; they kept landing on the net—and getting crushed. <i>Maybe</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:89822;left:108"><nobr><i>everyone who lives in the city gets to be slow and stupid like this, </i>I thought, and smiled, and went</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:89842;left:108"><nobr>to sleep.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:89884;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Had a good night among the roaches?&quot; they teased when I came to the common toilet.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:89925;left:108"><nobr>Any thought I had of rejoining the dormitory ended there. The room was full of roaches, but it</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:89946;left:108"><nobr>was mine, and no one teased me. One disadvantage was that the electric bell did not penetrate</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:89967;left:108"><nobr>this room—but that was a kind of advantage too, I discovered in time.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90008;left:108"><nobr>In the morning, after waiting my turn at the common toilet, and then my turn at the common</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90029;left:108"><nobr>sink, and then my turn at the common bathroom, I went up one flight of stairs, pushed open the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90050;left:108"><nobr>door to the parking lot, and walked to the spot where the Honda City was parked. The car had to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90070;left:108"><nobr>be wiped with a soft, wet cloth, inside and outside; a stick of incense had to be placed at the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90091;left:108"><nobr>small statue of the goddess Lakshmi, goddess of wealth, which sat above the instrument board—</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90111;left:108"><nobr>this had the double advantage of getting rid of the mosquitoes that had sneaked in at night, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90132;left:108"><nobr>scenting the insides with an aroma of religion. I wiped the seats—nice, plush leather seats; I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90153;left:108"><nobr>wiped the instruments; I lifted the leather mats on the floor and slapped the dust out of them.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90174;left:108"><nobr>There were three magnetic stickers with images of the mother-goddess Kali on the dashboard—I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90194;left:108"><nobr>had put them there, throwing out Ram Persad's magnetic stickers; I wiped them all. There was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90215;left:108"><nobr>also a small fluffy ogre with a red tongue sticking out of its mouth hung by a chain from the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90236;left:108"><nobr>rearview mirror. It was supposed to be a lucky charm, and the Stork liked to see it bob up and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90257;left:108"><nobr>down as we drove. I punched the ogre in the mouth—then I wiped it clean. Next came the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90277;left:108"><nobr>business of checking the box of paper tissues in the back of the car—it was elaborately carved</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90298;left:108"><nobr>and gilded, like something that a royal family had owned, though it was actually made of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90319;left:108"><nobr>cardboard. I made sure there were fresh tissues in the box. Pinky Madam used dozens of tissues </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:90575;left:108"><nobr>each time we went out—she said the pollution in Delhi was so bad. She had left her crushed and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90595;left:108"><nobr>crumpled used tissues near the box, and I had to pick them up and throw them out.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90637;left:108"><nobr>The electric buzzer sounded through the parking lot. A voice over the lobby microphone said,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90658;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Driver Balram. Please report to the main entrance of Buckingham B Block with the car.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90699;left:108"><nobr>And so it was that I would get into the Honda City, drive up a ramp, and come out to see my first</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90720;left:108"><nobr>sunlight of the day.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90761;left:108"><nobr>The brothers were dressed in posh suits—they were standing at the door to the building, chatting</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90782;left:108"><nobr>and chirruping; when they got in, the Mongoose said, &quot;The Congress Party headquarters, Balram.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90803;left:108"><nobr>We went there the other day—I hope you remember it and don't get lost again.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90844;left:108"><nobr><i>I'm not going to let you down today, sir.</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90885;left:108"><nobr>Rush hour in Delhi. Cars, scooters, motorbikes, autorickshaws, black taxis, jostling for space on</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90906;left:108"><nobr>the road. The pollution is so bad that the men on the motorbikes and scooters have a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90927;left:108"><nobr>handkerchief wrapped around their faces—each time you stop at a red light, you see a row of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90948;left:108"><nobr>men with black glasses and masks on their faces, as if the whole city were out on a bank heist</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:90968;left:108"><nobr>that morning.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91010;left:108"><nobr>There was a good reason for the face masks; they say the air is so bad in Delhi that it takes ten</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91030;left:108"><nobr>years out of a man's life. Of course, those in the cars don't have to breathe the outside air—it is</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91051;left:108"><nobr>just nice, cool, clean, air-conditioned air for us. With their tinted windows up, the cars of the rich</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91072;left:108"><nobr>go like dark eggs down the roads of Delhi. Every now and then an egg will crack open—a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91092;left:108"><nobr>woman's hand, dazzling with gold bangles, stretches out an open window, flings an empty</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91113;left:108"><nobr>mineral water bottle onto the road—and then the window goes up, and the egg is resealed.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91155;left:108"><nobr>I was taking my particular dark egg right into the heart of the city. To my left I saw the domes of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91175;left:108"><nobr>the President's House—the place where all the important business of the country is done. When</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91196;left:108"><nobr>the air pollution is really bad, the building is completely blotted out from the road; but today it</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91217;left:108"><nobr>shone beautifully.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91258;left:108"><nobr>In ten minutes, I was at the headquarters of the Congress Party. Now, this is an easy place to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91279;left:108"><nobr>find, because there are always two or three giant cardboard billboards with the face of Sonia</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91299;left:108"><nobr>Gandhi outside.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91341;left:108"><nobr>I stopped the car, ran out, and opened the door for Mr. Ashok and the Mongoose; as he got out,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91362;left:108"><nobr>Mr. Ashok said &quot;We'll be back in half an hour.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91403;left:108"><nobr>This confused me; they never told me in Dhanbad when they'd be back. Of course it meant</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91424;left:108"><nobr>nothing. They could take two hours to come back, or three. But it was a kind of courtesy that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91445;left:108"><nobr>they apparently now had to give me because we were in Delhi.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91486;left:108"><nobr>A group of farmers came to the headquarters, and weren't allowed inside, and shouted something</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91507;left:108"><nobr>or other, and left. A TV van came to the headquarters and honked; they were let in at once. </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:91783;left:108"><nobr>I yawned. I punched the little black ogre in its red mouth, and it bobbed back and forth. I turned</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91804;left:108"><nobr>my head around, from side to side.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91846;left:108"><nobr>I looked at the big poster of Sonia Gandhi. She was holding a hand up in the poster, as if waving</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91866;left:108"><nobr>to me—I waved back.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91908;left:108"><nobr>I yawned, closed my eyes, and slithered down my seat. With one eye open, I looked at the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91929;left:108"><nobr>magnetic sticker of the goddess Kali—who is a very fierce black-skinned goddess, holding a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91949;left:108"><nobr>scimitar, and a garland of skulls. I made a note to myself to change that sticker. She looked too</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:91970;left:108"><nobr>much like Granny.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92011;left:108"><nobr>Two hours later, the brothers returned to the car.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92053;left:108"><nobr>&quot;We're going to the President's House, Balram. Up the hill. You know the place?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92094;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Yes, sir, I've seen it.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92136;left:108"><nobr>Now, I'd already seen most of the famous sights of Delhi—the House of Parliament, the Jantar</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92156;left:108"><nobr>Mantar, the Qutub—but I'd not yet been to this place—the most important one of all. I drove</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92177;left:108"><nobr>toward Raisina Hill, and then all the way up the hill, stopping each time a guard put his hand out</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92198;left:108"><nobr>and checked inside the car, and then stopping right in front of one of the big domed buildings</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92218;left:108"><nobr>around the President's House.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92260;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Wait in the car, Balram. We'll be back in thirty minutes.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92301;left:108"><nobr>For the first half an hour, I was too frightened to get out of the car. I opened the door—I stepped</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92322;left:108"><nobr>out—I took a look around. Somewhere inside these domes and towers that were all around me,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92343;left:108"><nobr>the big men of this country—the prime minister, the president, top ministers and bureaucrats—</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92363;left:108"><nobr>were discussing things, and writing them out, and stamping papers. Someone was saying—</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92384;left:108"><nobr>&quot;There, five hundred million rupees for that dam!&quot;—and someone was saying—&quot;Fine, attack</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92405;left:108"><nobr>Pakistan, then!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92446;left:108"><nobr>I wanted to run around shouting: &quot;Balram is here too! Balram is here too!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92487;left:108"><nobr>I got back into the car to make sure I didn't do anything stupid and get arrested for it.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92529;left:108"><nobr>It was getting dark when the two brothers came out of the building; a fat man walked out with</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92550;left:108"><nobr>them, and talked to them for a while, outside the car, and then shook their hands and waved</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92570;left:108"><nobr>goodbye to us.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92612;left:108"><nobr>Mr. Ashok was dark and sullen when he got in. The Mongoose asked me to drive them back</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92633;left:108"><nobr>home—&quot;without making any mistakes again, understand?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:92674;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:92951;left:108"><nobr>They sat in silence, which confused me. If I had just gone into the President's House, I'd roll</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:93137;left:108"><nobr>I looked out the window to see a large bronze statue of a group of men—this is a well-known</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:93158;left:108"><nobr>statue, which you will no doubt see in Delhi: at the head is Mahatma Gandhi, with his walking</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:93261;left:108"><nobr>&quot;What about it? I've seen it before.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:93303;left:108"><nobr>&quot;We're driving past Gandhi, after just having given a bribe to a minister. It's a <i>fucking joke</i>, isn't</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:93365;left:108"><nobr>&quot;You sound like your wife now,&quot; the Mongoose said. &quot;I don't like swearing—it's not part of our</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:93427;left:108"><nobr>But Mr. Ashok was too red in the face to keep quiet.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:93468;left:108"><nobr>&quot;It is a <i>fucking joke</i>—our political system—and I'll keep saying it as long as I like.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:93510;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Things are complicated in India, Ashok. It's not like in America. Please reserve your judgment.&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:93590;left:108"><nobr>There was a fierce jam on the road to Gurgaon. Every five minutes the traffic would tremble—</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:93611;left:108"><nobr>we'd move a foot—hope would rise—then the red lights would flash on the cars ahead of me,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:93632;left:108"><nobr>and we'd be stuck again. Everyone honked. Every now and then, the various horns, each with its</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:93652;left:108"><nobr>own pitch, blended into one continuous wail that sounded like a calf taken from its mother.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:93673;left:108"><nobr>Fumes filled the air. Wisps of blue exhaust glowed in front of every headlight; the exhaust grew</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:93694;left:108"><nobr>so fat and thick it could not rise or escape, but spread horizontally, sluggish and glossy, making a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:93715;left:108"><nobr>kind of fog around us. Matches were continually being struck—the drivers of autorickshaws lit</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:93735;left:108"><nobr>cigarettes, adding tobacco pollution to petrol pollution.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:93777;left:108"><nobr>A man driving a buffalo cart had stopped in front of us; a pile of empty car engine oil cans</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:93798;left:108"><nobr>fifteen feet high had been tied by rope to his cart. His poor water buffalo! To carry all that load—</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:93818;left:108"><nobr>while sucking in this air!</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:93859;left:108"><nobr>The autorickshaw driver next to me began to cough violently—he turned to the side and spat,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:93880;left:108"><nobr>three times in a row. Some of the spit flecked the side of the Honda City. I glared—I raised my</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:94305;left:108"><nobr>&quot;In Beijing apparently they've got a dozen ring roads. Here we have <i>one. </i>No wonder we keep</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:94408;left:108"><nobr>Dim streetlights were glowing down onto the pavement on either side of the traffic; and in that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:94429;left:108"><nobr>orange-hued half-light, I could see multitudes of small, thin, grimy people squatting, waiting for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:94449;left:108"><nobr>a bus to take them somewhere, or with nowhere to go and about to unfurl a mattress and sleep</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:94470;left:108"><nobr>right there. These poor bastards had come from the darkness to Delhi to find some light—but</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:94491;left:108"><nobr>they were still in the darkness. Hundreds of them, there seemed to be, on either side of the traffic,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:94512;left:108"><nobr>and their life was entirely unaffected by the jam. Were they even aware that there was a jam? We</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:94532;left:108"><nobr>were like two separate cities—inside and outside the dark egg. I knew I was in the right city. But</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:94553;left:108"><nobr>my father, if he were alive, would be sitting on that pavement, cooking some rice gruel for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:94574;left:108"><nobr>dinner, and getting ready to lie down and sleep under a streetlamp, and I couldn't stop thinking of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:94594;left:108"><nobr>that and recognizing his features in some beggar out there. So I was in some way out of the car</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:94615;left:108"><nobr>too, even while I was driving it.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:94656;left:108"><nobr>After an hour of thrashing through the traffic, we got home at last to Buckingham B Block. But</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:94677;left:108"><nobr>the torture wasn't over.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:94719;left:108"><nobr>As he was getting out of the car, the Mongoose tapped his pockets, looked confused for a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:94739;left:108"><nobr>moment, and said, &quot;I've lost a rupee.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:94781;left:108"><nobr>He snapped his fingers at me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:94822;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Get down on your knees. Look for it on the floor of the car.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:94863;left:108"><nobr>I got down on my knees. I sniffed in between the mats like a dog, all in search of that one rupee.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:94905;left:108"><nobr>&quot;What do you mean, it's not there? Don't think you can steal from us just because you're in the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:94926;left:108"><nobr>city. I want that rupee.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:94967;left:108"><nobr>&quot;We've just paid half a million rupees in a bribe, Mukesh, and now we're screwing this man over</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:94988;left:108"><nobr>for a single rupee. Let's go up and have a scotch.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:95029;left:108"><nobr>&quot;That's how you corrupt servants. It starts with one rupee. Don't bring your American ways</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:95327;left:108"><nobr>Where that rupee coin went remains a mystery to me to this day, Mr. Premier. Finally, I took a</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:95451;left:108"><nobr>There was a childish delight on his dark master's face. He put the rupee coin in his hand and</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:95513;left:108"><nobr>I took the elevator up with the brothers, to see if any work was to be done in the apartment.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:95575;left:108"><nobr>turned the TV off, and went into another room. The Mongoose said he didn't want dinner, so Mr.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:95596;left:108"><nobr>Ashok would have to eat alone at the dinner table. He asked me to heat some of the vegetables in</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:95658;left:108"><nobr>Casting a quick look back as I opened the fridge door, I saw that he was on the verge of tears.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:95884;left:108"><nobr>that sentence ended.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:95925;left:108"><nobr>I knew something was wrong, but I hadn't realized how bad the situation had become until the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:95987;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; I hesitated. I wanted to ask, <i>Just him?</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:96028;left:108"><nobr>Did that mean he was going back for good? Did that mean Pinky Madam had finally got rid of</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:96091;left:108"><nobr>At six o'clock, I waited with the car outside the entranceway. I drove the brothers to the railway</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:96153;left:108"><nobr>I carried the Mongoose's bags to the right carriage of the train, then went to a stall and bought a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:96174;left:108"><nobr><i>dosa, </i>wrapped in paper, for him. That was what he always liked to eat on the train. But I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:96194;left:108"><nobr>unwrapped the <i>dosa </i>and removed the potatoes, flinging them onto the rail tracks, because</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:96215;left:108"><nobr>potatoes made him fart, and he didn't like that. A servant gets to know his master's intestinal tract</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:97095;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:97136;left:108"><nobr>The Mongoose turned to Mr. Ashok and touched him on the forearm. &quot;Take some interest in this,</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:97198;left:108"><nobr>But Mr. Ashok was playing with his cell phone. He put it down and said, &quot;The driver's honest.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:97219;left:108"><nobr>He's from Laxmangarh. I saw his family when I went there.&quot; Then he went back to his cell</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:97281;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Don't talk like that. Don't make a joke of what I'm saying,&quot; the Mongoose said.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:97322;left:108"><nobr>But he was paying no attention to his brother—he kept punching the buttons on his cell phone:</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:97343;left:108"><nobr>&quot;One minute, one minute, I'm talking to a friend in New York.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:97385;left:108"><nobr>Drivers like to say that some men are <i>first-gear </i>types. Mr. Ashok was a classic <i>first-gear man</i>.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:97703;left:108"><nobr>wonder. Firstly, you could &quot;talk&quot; on a cell phone—to someone in New York—just by punching</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:97723;left:108"><nobr>on its buttons. The wonders of modern science never cease to amaze me!</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:97765;left:108"><nobr>Secondly, I realized that this tall, broad-shouldered, handsome, foreign-educated man, who</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:97786;left:108"><nobr>would be my only master in a few minutes, when the long whistle blew and this train headed off</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:97806;left:108"><nobr>toward Dhanbad, was weak, helpless, absentminded, and completely unprotected by the usual</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:97931;left:108"><nobr>apologizing to him.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:97972;left:108"><nobr>That evening, at eight o'clock, Mr. Ashok sent a message to me through another servant: &quot;Be</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:97993;left:108"><nobr>ready in half an hour, Balram. Pinky Madam and I will be going out.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:98034;left:108"><nobr>And the two of them did come down, about two and three-quarters of an hour later.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:98076;left:108"><nobr>The moment the Mongoose left, I swear, the skirts became even shorter.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:98117;left:108"><nobr>When she sat in the back, I could see half her boobs hanging out of her clothes each time I had to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:98138;left:108"><nobr>look in the rearview mirror.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:98179;left:108"><nobr>This put me in a very bad situation, sir. For one thing, my beak was aroused, which is natural in a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:98200;left:108"><nobr>healthy young man like me. On the other hand, as you know, master and mistress are like father</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:98220;left:108"><nobr>and mother to you, so how can you get excited by the mistress?</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:98262;left:108"><nobr>I simply avoided looking at the rearview mirror. If there was a crash, it wouldn't be my fault.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:98303;left:108"><nobr>Mr. Premier, maybe when you have been driving, in the thick traffic, you have stopped your car</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:98324;left:108"><nobr>and lowered your window; and then you have felt the hot, panting breath of the exhaust pipe of a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:98345;left:108"><nobr>truck next to you. Now be aware, Mr. Premier, that there is a hot panting diesel engine just in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:98366;left:108"><nobr>front of your own nose.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:98407;left:108"><nobr><i>Me.</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:98448;left:108"><nobr>Each time she came in with that low black dress, my beak got big. I hated her for wearing that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:98469;left:108"><nobr>dress; but I hated my beak even more for what it was doing.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:98550;left:108"><nobr>At the end of the month, I went up to the apartment. He was sitting there, alone, on the couch</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:98570;left:108"><nobr>beneath the framed photo of the two Pomeranians.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:99222;left:108"><nobr>At ten o'clock that night I walked down to the market just around the corner from Buckingham</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:99243;left:108"><nobr>Towers B Block. It was the last shop in the market; on a billboard above it, huge black letters in</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:99408;left:108"><nobr>boys behind the counter couldn't hear a word of what was being said in that din, and kept getting</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:99429;left:108"><nobr>orders mixed up, and that led to more yelling and fighting. I pushed through the crowd—got to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:99450;left:108"><nobr>the counter, banged my fist, and yelled, &quot;Whiskey! The cheapest kind! Immediate service—or</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:99512;left:108"><nobr>It took me fifteen minutes to get a bottle. I stuffed it down my trousers, for there was nowhere</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:100886;left:108"><nobr>rotting from <i>paan. </i>I washed my mouth out, but the lips were still red.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:100928;left:108"><nobr>She was right. The <i>paan</i>—which I'd chewed for years, like my father and like Kishan and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:100949;left:108"><nobr>everyone else I knew—was discoloring my teeth and corroding my gums.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:100990;left:108"><nobr>The next evening, Mr. Ashok and Pinky Madam came down to the entranceway fighting, got into</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:101011;left:108"><nobr>the car fighting, and kept fighting as I drove the Honda City from Buckingham Towers B Block </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:101950;left:108"><nobr>It was the driver with the diseased lips. I put a big smile on my face and went up to him.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:101991;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Any more questions about city life, Country-Mouse?&quot; he asked. Cannonades of laughter all</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:102137;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Don't offer him all these things now,&quot; another driver said. This one was crouching on his knees,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:102157;left:108"><nobr>swinging a key chain with the keys to his master's car like a boy with a toy. &quot;He's raw from the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:102972;left:108"><nobr>For a moment the man at the door looked ready to hit the guard—but then he turned around and</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:103035;left:108"><nobr>&quot;That fellow has balls,&quot; one of the drivers said. &quot;If all of us were like that, we'd rule India, and</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:103138;left:108"><nobr>I watched the keys circling in the key chain. I watched the smoke rising from the cigarettes. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:103159;left:108"><nobr>watched the <i>paan </i>hit the earth in red diagonals.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:103345;left:108"><nobr>But if the driver sees his free time as an opportunity, if he uses it to think, then the worst part of</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:103643;left:108"><nobr>That evening, while driving back to the apartment, I looked into the rearview mirror. Mr. Ashok</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:103663;left:108"><nobr>was wearing a T-shirt.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:103705;left:108"><nobr>It was like no T-shirt I would ever choose to buy at a store. The larger part of it was empty and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:103726;left:108"><nobr>white and there was a small design in the center. I would have bought something very colorful,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:103746;left:108"><nobr>with lots of words and designs on it. Better value for the money.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:103788;left:108"><nobr>Then one night, after Mr. Ashok and Pinky Madam had gone up, I went out to the local market.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:103891;left:108"><nobr>&quot;No,&quot; I kept saying to each shirt he showed me—until I found one that was all white, with a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:103912;left:108"><nobr>small word in English in the center. Then I went looking for the man selling black shoes.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:103953;left:108"><nobr>I bought my first toothpaste that night. I got it from the man who usually sold me <i>paan</i>; he had a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:103974;left:108"><nobr>side business in toothpastes that canceled out the effects of <i>paan.</i></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:104036;left:108"><nobr>WITH CHARCOAL AND CLOVES TO CLEAN YOUR TEETH</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:104057;left:108"><nobr>ONLY ONE RUPEE FIFTY PAISE!</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:104098;left:108"><nobr>As I brushed my teeth with my finger, I noticed what my left hand was doing: it had crawled up</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:104119;left:108"><nobr>to my groin without my noticing—the way a lizard goes stealthily up a wall—and was about to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:104140;left:108"><nobr>scratch.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:104181;left:108"><nobr>I waited. The moment it moved, I seized it with the right hand.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:104223;left:108"><nobr>I pinched the thick skin between the thumb and the index finger, where it hurts the most, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:104243;left:108"><nobr>held it like that for a whole minute. When I let go, a red welt had formed on the skin of the palm.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:104285;left:108"><nobr>There.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:104326;left:108"><nobr>That's your punishment for groin-scratching from now on.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:104367;left:108"><nobr>In my mouth, the toothpaste had thickened into a milky foam; it began dripping down the sides</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:104388;left:108"><nobr>of my lips. I spat it out.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:104430;left:108"><nobr>Brush. Brush. Spit.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:105201;left:108"><nobr>I was sure the guard in front of the door would challenge me and say, <i>No, you're not allowed in,</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:105222;left:108"><nobr>even with a pair of black shoes and a T-shirt that is mostly white with just one English word on</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:105243;left:108"><nobr>it. I was sure, until the last moment, that I would be caught, and called back, and slapped and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:105263;left:108"><nobr>humiliated there.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:105305;left:108"><nobr>Even as I was walking inside the mall, I was sure someone would say, <i>Hey! That man is a paid</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:105325;left:108"><nobr><i>driver! What's he doing in here? </i>There were guards in gray uniforms on every floor—all of them</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:105346;left:108"><nobr>seemed to be watching me. It was my first taste of the fugitive's life.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:105388;left:108"><nobr>I was conscious of a perfume in the air, of golden light, of cool, air-conditioned air, of people in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:105408;left:108"><nobr>T-shirts and jeans who were eyeing me strangely. I saw an elevator going up and down that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:105429;left:108"><nobr>seemed made of pure golden glass. I saw shops with walls of glass, and huge photos of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:105450;left:108"><nobr>handsome European men and women hanging on each wall. If only the other drivers could see</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:105512;left:108"><nobr>Getting out was as tricky as getting in, but again the guards didn't say a word to me, and I walked</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:105532;left:108"><nobr>back to the parking lot, got into the car, and changed back into my usual, richly colored shirt, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:105553;left:108"><nobr>left the rich man's plain T-shirt in a bundle near my feet.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:105595;left:108"><nobr>I came running out to where the other drivers were sitting. None of them had noticed me going in</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:106576;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Why not? You promised me, Ashoky, we'll be in Delhi just three months and get some</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:106596;left:108"><nobr>paperwork done and go back. But I'm starting to think you only came here to deal with this</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:106617;left:108"><nobr>income-tax problem. Were you lying to me the whole time?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:106658;left:108"><nobr>It wasn't his fault, what happened between them—I will insist on that, even in a court of law. He</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:106679;left:108"><nobr>was a good husband, always coming up with plans to make her happy. On her birthday, for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:106700;left:108"><nobr>instance, he had me dress up as a maharaja, with a red turban and dark cooling glasses, and serve</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:106720;left:108"><nobr>them their food in this costume. I'm not talking of any ordinary home cooking, either—he got me</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:106741;left:108"><nobr>to serve her some of that stinking stuff that comes in cardboard boxes and drives all the rich</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:106762;left:108"><nobr>absolutely crazy.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:106803;left:108"><nobr>She laughed and laughed and laughed when she saw me in my costume, bowing low to her with</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:106824;left:108"><nobr>the cardboard box. I served them, and then, as Mr. Ashok had instructed, stood near the portrait</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:106845;left:108"><nobr>of Cuddles and Puddles with folded hands and waited.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:106886;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Ashok,&quot; she said. &quot;Now hear this. Balram, what is it we're eating?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:106927;left:108"><nobr>I knew it was a trap, but what could I do?—I answered. The two of them burst into giggles.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:106969;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Say it again, Balram.&quot; </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:107352;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Don't correct <i>my </i>English, Ashok. There's no <i>T </i>in pizza. Look at the box.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:107393;left:108"><nobr>I had to hold my breath as I stood there waiting for them to finish. The stuff smelled so awful.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:107435;left:108"><nobr>&quot;He's cut the pizza so badly. I just don't understand how he can come from a caste of cooks.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:107476;left:108"><nobr>&quot;You've just dismissed the cook. Please don't fire this fellow too—he's an honest one.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:107517;left:108"><nobr>When they were done, I scraped the food off the plates and washed them. From the kitchen</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:107538;left:108"><nobr>window, I could see the main road of Gurgaon, full of the lights of the shopping malls. A new</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:107559;left:108"><nobr>mall had just opened up at the end of the road, and the cars were streaming into its gates.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:107600;left:108"><nobr>I pulled the window shade down and went back to washing dishes.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:107642;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Pijja.&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:107807;left:108"><nobr>I wiped the sink with my palm and turned off the lights.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:107849;left:108"><nobr>The two of them had gone into their bedroom. I heard shouting from inside. On tiptoe, I went to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:107870;left:108"><nobr>the closed door. I put my ear to the wood.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:107911;left:108"><nobr>Shouting rose from both sides—followed by a scream—followed by the sound of man's flesh</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:107931;left:108"><nobr>slapping woman's flesh.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:107973;left:108"><nobr>About time you took charge, O Lamb-that-was-born-from-the-loins-of-a-landlord. I locked the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:108035;left:108"><nobr>Half an hour later, just when I was about to fall asleep, another of the servants came and yelled</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:108056;left:108"><nobr>for me. The bell was ringing! I put on my pants, washed my hands again and again at the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:108077;left:108"><nobr>common tap, and drove the car up to the entrance of the building.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:108478;left:108"><nobr>No word from her.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:108519;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Take us to Connaught Place, Balram.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:108561;left:108"><nobr>Neither husband nor wife talked as I drove. I still had the maharaja outfit on. Mr. Ashok looked</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:108623;left:108"><nobr>&quot;You're right, Pinky,&quot; he said in a husky voice. &quot;I didn't mean to challenge you on what you said.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:108643;left:108"><nobr>But I told you, there's only one thing wrong with this place—we have this fucked-up system</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:108664;left:108"><nobr>called parliamentary democracy. Otherwise, we'd be just like China—&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:108705;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Ashok. I have a headache. Please.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:108747;left:108"><nobr>&quot;We'll have some fun tonight. There's a good T.G.I. Friday's here. You'll like it.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:108788;left:108"><nobr>When we got to Connaught Place, he made me stop in front of a big red neon light.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:108830;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Wait for us here, Balram. We'll be back in twenty minutes.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:108871;left:108"><nobr>They had been gone for an hour and I was still inside the car, watching the lights of Connaught</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:108892;left:108"><nobr>Place.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:108933;left:108"><nobr>I punched the fluffy black ogre a dozen times. I looked at the magnetic stickers of goddess Kali</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:108954;left:108"><nobr>with her skulls and her long red tongue—I stuck my tongue out at the old witch. I yawned.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:108995;left:108"><nobr>It was well past midnight and very cold.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:109037;left:108"><nobr>I would have loved to play some music to pass the time, but of course the Mongoose had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:109058;left:108"><nobr>forbidden that.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:109099;left:108"><nobr>I opened the door of the car: there was an acrid smell in the air. The other drivers had made a fire</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:109119;left:108"><nobr>for themselves, which they kept going by shoving bits of plastic into it.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:109161;left:108"><nobr>The rich of Delhi, to survive the winter, keep electrical heaters, or gas heaters, or even burn logs</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:109182;left:108"><nobr>of wood in their fireplaces. When the homeless, or servants like night watchmen and drivers who</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:109202;left:108"><nobr>are forced to spend time outside in winter, want to keep warm, they burn whatever they find on</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:109223;left:108"><nobr>the ground. One of the best things to put in the fire is cellophane, the kind used to wrap fruits,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:109244;left:108"><nobr>vegetables, and business books in: inside the flame, it changes its nature and melts into a clear</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:109265;left:108"><nobr>fuel. The only problem is that while burning, it gives off a white smoke that makes your stomach</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:109285;left:108"><nobr>churn.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:109327;left:108"><nobr>Vitiligo-Lips was feeding bags of cellophane into the fire; with his free hand he waved to me. </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:109873;left:108"><nobr>There is construction work in any direction you look in Delhi. Glass skeletons being raised for</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:109956;left:108"><nobr>glare of immense spotlights, construction went on. A giant pit had been excavated. Machines</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:109976;left:108"><nobr>were rumbling from inside it.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:110018;left:108"><nobr>I had heard of this work: they were putting a railway under the ground of Delhi. The pit they had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:110038;left:108"><nobr>made for this work was as large as any of the coal mines I'd seen in Dhanbad. Another man was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:110059;left:108"><nobr>watching the pit with me—a well-dressed man in a shirt and tie and pants with nice pleats.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:110080;left:108"><nobr>Normally his kind would never talk to me, but maybe my maharaja tunic confused him.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:110163;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Five?&quot; I said contemptuously. &quot;In <i>two </i>years!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:110204;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Look at that yellow crane. It's a monster.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:110246;left:108"><nobr>It <i>was </i>a monster, sitting at the top of the pit with huge metal jaws alternately gorging and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:110266;left:108"><nobr>disgorging immense quantities of mud. Like creatures that had to obey it, men with troughs of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:110287;left:108"><nobr>mud on their heads walked in circles around the machine; they did not look much bigger than</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:110307;left:108"><nobr>mice. Even in the winter night the sweat had made their shirts stick to their glistening black</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:110328;left:108"><nobr>bodies.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:110370;left:108"><nobr>It was freezing cold when I returned to the car. All the other drivers had left. Still no sign of my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:110390;left:108"><nobr>masters. I closed my eyes and tried to remember what I had had for dinner.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:110432;left:108"><nobr>A nice hot curry with juicy chunks of dark meat. Big puddles of red oil in the gravy.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:110473;left:108"><nobr>Nice.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:110515;left:108"><nobr>They woke me up by banging on my window. I scrambled out and opened the doors for them. </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:111081;left:108"><nobr>She became grumpy at once, and turned her face to the side. Five minutes passed in silence.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:111434;left:108"><nobr>Completely confused by this time, I compromised—I took the car five feet in front of the white</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:111495;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Did you see what he did?&quot; Mr. Ashok said. &quot;That was pretty clever.&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:111661;left:108"><nobr>statues or strawberries in boxes—but for some reason, perhaps because my nerves were in such a</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:112518;left:108"><nobr>I stopped the car.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:112559;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Balram, get out. We're leaving you to spend the night with your Buddha. The maharaja and the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:112580;left:108"><nobr>Buddha, together for the night.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:112622;left:108"><nobr>She got into the driver's seat, started the car, and drove away, while Mr. Ashok, dead drunk,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:112642;left:108"><nobr>giggled and waved goodbye at me. If he hadn't been drunk, he never would have allowed her to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:112663;left:108"><nobr>treat me like this—I'm <i>sure </i>of that. People were always taking advantage of him. If it were just</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:112683;left:108"><nobr>me and him in that car, nothing bad would ever have happened to either of us.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:112725;left:108"><nobr>There was a traffic island separating the two sides of the road, and trees had been planted in the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:112746;left:108"><nobr>island. I sat down under a tree.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:112787;left:108"><nobr>The road was dead—then two cars went by, one behind the other, their headlights making a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:112808;left:108"><nobr>continuous ripple on the leaves, like you see on the branches of trees that grow by a lake. How</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:112829;left:108"><nobr>many thousands of such beautiful things there must be to see in Delhi. If you were just free to go</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:112849;left:108"><nobr>wherever you wanted, and do whatever you wanted.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:112891;left:108"><nobr>A car was coming straight toward me, flashing its headlights on and off and sounding its horns. </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:113333;left:108"><nobr>The car stopped half a foot in front of me, with a screech of burning rubber. I cringed: how my</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:113395;left:108"><nobr>Pinky Madam opened the door and popped her grinning face out.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:113437;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Thought I had really left you behind, Mr. Maharaja?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:113478;left:108"><nobr>&quot;No, madam.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:113520;left:108"><nobr>&quot;You're not angry, are you?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:113561;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Not at all.&quot; And then I added, to make it more believable, &quot;Employers are like mother and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:113582;left:108"><nobr>father. How can one be angry with them?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:113623;left:108"><nobr>I got into the backseat. They did another U-turn across the middle of the avenue, and then drove</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:113644;left:108"><nobr>off at top speed, racing through one red light after the other. The two of them were shrieking, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:113664;left:108"><nobr>pinching each other, and making giggling noises, and, helpless to do anything, I was just</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:113685;left:108"><nobr>watching the show from the backseat, when the small black thing jumped into our path, and we</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:113706;left:108"><nobr>hit it and knocked it over and rolled the wheels of the car over it.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:113747;left:108"><nobr>From the way the wheels crunched it completely, and from how there was no noise when she</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:113768;left:108"><nobr>stopped the car, not even a whimper or a barking, I knew at once what had happened to the thing</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:113789;left:108"><nobr>we had hit.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:113830;left:108"><nobr>She was too drunk to brake at once—by the time she had, we had hurtled on another two or three</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:113851;left:108"><nobr>hundred yards, and then we came to a complete stop. In the middle of the road. She had kept her</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:113871;left:108"><nobr>hands on the wheel; her mouth was open.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:113913;left:108"><nobr>&quot;A dog?&quot; Mr. Ashok asked me. &quot;It was a dog, wasn't it?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:113954;left:108"><nobr>I nodded. The streetlights were too dim, and the object—a large black lump—was too far behind</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:113975;left:108"><nobr>us already to be seen clearly. There was no other car in sight. No other living human being in</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:114037;left:108"><nobr>As if in slow motion, her hands moved back from the wheel and covered her ears.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:114355;left:108"><nobr>Without a word between us, Mr. Ashok and I acted as a team. He grabbed her, put a hand on her</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:114687;left:108"><nobr>Mr. Ashok gagged her with his palm—he reached for the box of facial tissues and stuffed the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:114708;left:108"><nobr>tissues into her mouth; while she tried to spit them out, he tore the scarf from around her neck,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:114728;left:108"><nobr>tied it tightly around her mouth, and shoved her face into his lap and held it down there.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:114770;left:108"><nobr>When we got to the apartment, he dragged her to the elevator with the scarf still around her</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:114832;left:108"><nobr>I got a bucket and washed the car. I wiped it down thoroughly, and scrubbed out every bit of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:114852;left:108"><nobr>blood and flesh—there was a bit of both around the wheels.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:114894;left:108"><nobr>When he came down, I was washing the tires for the fourth time.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:114935;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Well?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:114977;left:108"><nobr>I showed him a piece of bloodied green fabric that had got stuck to the wheel.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:115018;left:108"><nobr>&quot;It's cheap stuff, sir, this green cloth,&quot; I said, rubbing the rough material between my fingers. &quot;It's</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:115039;left:108"><nobr>what they put on children.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:115077;left:108"><nobr>&quot;And do you think the child…&quot; He couldn't say the word.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:115122;left:108"><nobr>&quot;There was no sound at all, sir. No sound at all. And the body didn't move even a bit.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:115163;left:108"><nobr>&quot;God, Balram, what will we do now—what will we—&quot; He slapped his hand to his thigh. &quot;What</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:115647;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I don't think so, sir. You know how those people in the Darkness are: they have eight, nine, ten</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:115958;left:108"><nobr>The next morning, I wiped the seats of the car as usual—I wiped the stickers with the face of the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:115978;left:108"><nobr>goddess—I wiped the ogre—and then I lit up the incense stick and put it inside so that the seats</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:115999;left:108"><nobr>would smell nice and holy. I washed the wheels one more time, to make sure there was not a spot</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:116020;left:108"><nobr>of blood I had missed in the night.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:116061;left:108"><nobr>Then I went back to my room and waited. In the evening one of the other drivers brought a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:116082;left:108"><nobr>message that I was wanted in the lobby—without the car. The Mongoose was waiting for me up</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:116103;left:108"><nobr>there. I don't know how he got to Delhi this fast—he must have rented a car and driven all night.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:116123;left:108"><nobr>He gave me a big smile and patted me on the shoulder. We went up to the apartment in the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:116186;left:108"><nobr>He sat down on the table, and said, &quot;Sit, sit, make yourself comfortable, Balram. You're part of</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:116247;left:108"><nobr>My heart filled up with pride. I crouched on the floor, happy as a dog, and waited for him to say</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:116268;left:108"><nobr>it again. He smoked a cigarette. I had never before seen him do that. He looked at me with</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:116330;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Now, it's important that you stay here in Buckingham Towers B Block and not go anywhere</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:116351;left:108"><nobr>else—not even to A Block—for a few days. And not say a word to anyone about what</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:116372;left:108"><nobr>happened.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:116413;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:117291;left:108"><nobr>The man in the black coat reached into his pocket and held out a small green <i>paan. </i>I stuck my</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:119128;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Yes, that's it. Kusum. I drove down to Laxmangarh—it's a bad road, isn't it?—and explained</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:119294;left:108"><nobr>&quot;If he's illiterate, he can press his thumb,&quot; the man in the black coat said. &quot;Like this.&quot; He pressed</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:119356;left:108"><nobr>&quot;He's literate. His grandmother told me he was the first in the family to read and write. She said</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:119377;left:108"><nobr>you always were a smart boy, Balram.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:119418;left:108"><nobr>I looked at the paper, pretending to read it again, and it began to shake in my hands.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:119646;left:108"><nobr>The jails of Delhi are full of drivers who are there behind bars because they are taking the blame</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:119811;left:108"><nobr>Doesn't the driver's family protest? Far from it. They would actually go about bragging. Their</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:119832;left:108"><nobr>boy Balram had taken the fall, gone to Tihar Jail for his employer. He was loyal as a dog. He was</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:119894;left:108"><nobr>The judges? Wouldn't they see through this obviously forced confession? But they are in the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:120622;left:108"><nobr>Go to Old Delhi, behind the Jama Masjid, and look at the way they keep chickens there in the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:120643;left:108"><nobr>market. Hundreds of pale hens and brightly colored roosters, stuffed tightly into wire-mesh</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:120663;left:108"><nobr>cages, packed as tightly as worms in a belly, pecking each other and shitting on each other,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:120684;left:108"><nobr>jostling just for breathing space; the whole cage giving off a horrible stench—the stench of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:120705;left:108"><nobr>terrified, feathered flesh. On the wooden desk above this coop sits a grinning young butcher,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:120726;left:108"><nobr>showing off the flesh and organs of a recently chopped-up chicken, still oleaginous with a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:120746;left:108"><nobr>coating of dark blood. The roosters in the coop smell the blood from above. They see the organs</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:120767;left:108"><nobr>of their brothers lying around them. They know they're next. Yet they do not rebel. They do not</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:120829;left:108"><nobr>The very same thing is done with human beings in this country.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:120912;left:108"><nobr>Every day furniture is delivered to people's homes by this man—the deliveryman. A bed costs</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:120933;left:108"><nobr>five thousand rupees, maybe six thousand. Add the chairs, and a coffee table, and it's ten or</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:120953;left:108"><nobr>fifteen thousand. A man comes on a cycle-cart, bringing you this bed, table, and chairs, a poor</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:120974;left:108"><nobr>man who may make five hundred rupees a month. He unloads all this furniture for you, and you</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:120995;left:108"><nobr>give him the money in cash—a fat wad of cash the size of a brick. He puts it into his pocket, or</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:121016;left:108"><nobr>into his shirt, or into his underwear, and cycles back to his boss and hands it over without</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:121036;left:108"><nobr>touching a single rupee of it! A year's salary, two years' salary, in his hands, and he never takes a</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:121794;left:108"><nobr>me. But he's in the Rooster Coop. The trustworthiness of servants is the basis of the entire Indian</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:121856;left:108"><nobr>The Great Indian Rooster Coop. Do you have something like it in China too? I doubt it, Mr.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:121960;left:108"><nobr>That's because we have the coop.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:122001;left:108"><nobr>Never before in human history have so few owed so much to so many, Mr. Jiabao. A handful of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:122022;left:108"><nobr>men in this country have trained the remaining 99.9 percent—as strong, as talented, as intelligent</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:122043;left:108"><nobr>in every way—to exist in perpetual servitude; a servitude so strong that you can put the key of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:122063;left:108"><nobr>his emancipation in a man's hands and he will throw it back at you with a curse.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:122105;left:108"><nobr>You'll have to come here and see it for yourself to believe it. Every day millions wake up at</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:122126;left:108"><nobr>dawn—stand in dirty, crowded buses—get off at their masters' posh houses—and then clean the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:122146;left:108"><nobr>floors, wash the dishes, weed the garden, feed their children, press their feet—all for a pittance. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:122167;left:108"><nobr>will never envy the rich of America or England, Mr. Jiabao: they have no servants there. They</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:122187;left:108"><nobr>cannot even <i>begin </i>to understand what a good life is.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:122229;left:108"><nobr>Now, a thinking man like you, Mr. Premier, must ask two questions.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:122270;left:108"><nobr>Why does the Rooster Coop work? How does it trap so many millions of men and women so</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:122291;left:108"><nobr>effectively?</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:122333;left:108"><nobr>Secondly, can a man break out of the coop? What if one day, for instance, a driver took his</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:122353;left:108"><nobr>employer's money and ran? What would his life be like?</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:123042;left:108"><nobr>When I saw that sign, I thought, <i>I can do that—I can do that with no trouble at all.</i></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:123311;left:108"><nobr>I remembered a story from <i>Murder Weekly </i>in which a man sent to jail pretended to have AIDS</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:123880;left:108"><nobr>are you ill? Is it typhoid? Cholera? Dengue?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:123922;left:108"><nobr>I shook my head. &quot;I'm fine.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:123963;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Good to hear that.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:124005;left:108"><nobr>With a big smile of his diseased lips, he left.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:124046;left:108"><nobr>I went up like a man to his hanging—up the stairs, and into the apartment building, and then up</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:124067;left:108"><nobr>the elevator to the thirteenth floor.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:124108;left:108"><nobr>The Mongoose opened the door. There was no smile on his face this time—not a hint of what he</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:124129;left:108"><nobr>had planned for me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:124170;left:108"><nobr>&quot;You took your time coming. Father is here. He wants to have a word with you.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:124212;left:108"><nobr>My heart raced. The Stork was here! <i>He </i>would save me! He wasn't useless, like his two sons. He</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:124232;left:108"><nobr>was an old-fashioned master. He knew he had to protect his servants.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:124274;left:108"><nobr>He was on the sofa, with his pale legs stretched out. As soon as he saw me his face broke open in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:124294;left:108"><nobr>a big smile, and I thought, <i>He's smiling because he's saved me! </i>But the old landlord wasn't</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:124315;left:108"><nobr>thinking of me at all. Oh, no, he was thinking of things far more important than my life. He</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:124336;left:108"><nobr>pointed to those two important things.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:124377;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Aah, Balram, my feet really need a good massage. It was a long trip by train.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:124419;left:108"><nobr>My hand shook as it turned on the hot-water faucet in the bathroom. The water hit the bottom of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:124439;left:108"><nobr>the bucket and splashed all over my legs, and when I looked down I saw that they were almost</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:124460;left:108"><nobr>rattling. A trickle of urine was running down them.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:124502;left:108"><nobr>A minute later, a big smile on my face, I came to where the Stork was sitting and placed the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:124522;left:108"><nobr>bucket of hot water near him.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:124563;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Put your feet in, sir.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:124605;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Oh,&quot; he said, and closed his eyes; his lips parted and he began to make little moans, sir, and the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:124626;left:108"><nobr>sound of those moans drove me to press his feet harder and harder; my body began rocking as I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:124646;left:108"><nobr>did so and my head knocked the sides of his knees.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:124688;left:108"><nobr>The Mongoose and Mr. Ashok were sitting in front of a TV screen, playing a computer game</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:124709;left:108"><nobr>together.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:124750;left:108"><nobr>The door to the bedroom opened, and Pinky Madam came out. She had no makeup on, and her</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:124771;left:108"><nobr>face was a mess—black skin under her eyes, lines on her forehead. The moment she saw me, she </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:125110;left:108"><nobr>The Stork said nothing. Mr. Ashok and the Mongoose kept playing the game. &quot;Has no one told</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:125317;left:108"><nobr>&quot;We have a contact in the police—he's told us that no one has reported seeing the accident. So</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:125337;left:108"><nobr>your help won't be needed, Balram.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:125379;left:108"><nobr>I felt such tremendous relief that I moved my hands abruptly, and the bucket of warm water</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:125400;left:108"><nobr>spilled over, and then I scrambled to put the bucket upright. The Stork opened his eyes, smacked</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:125420;left:108"><nobr>me on the head with his hand, and then closed his eyes.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:125462;left:108"><nobr>Pinky Madam watched; her face changed. She ran into her room and slammed the door. (Who</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:125482;left:108"><nobr>would have thought, Mr. Jiabao, that of this whole family, the lady with the short skirt would be</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:125503;left:108"><nobr>the one with a conscience?)</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:125544;left:108"><nobr>The Stork watched her go into her room and said, &quot;She's gone crazy, that woman. Wanting to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:125565;left:108"><nobr>find the family of the child and give them compensation—craziness. As if we were all murderers</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:125586;left:108"><nobr>here.&quot; He looked sternly at Mr. Ashok. &quot;You need to control that wife of yours better, son. The</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:125607;left:108"><nobr>way we do it in the village.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:125648;left:108"><nobr>Then he gave me a light tap on the head and said, &quot;The water's gone cold.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:125690;left:108"><nobr>I massaged his feet every morning for the next three days. One morning he had a little pain in his</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:125710;left:108"><nobr>stomach, so the Mongoose made me drive him down to Max, which is one of Delhi's most</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:125731;left:108"><nobr>famous private hospitals. I stood outside and watched as the Mongoose and the old man went</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:125751;left:108"><nobr>inside the beautiful big glass building. Doctors walked in and out with long white coats, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:125772;left:108"><nobr>stethoscopes in their pockets. When I peeped in from outside, the hospital's lobby looked as</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:125793;left:108"><nobr>clean as the inside of a five-star hotel.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:125834;left:108"><nobr>The day after the hospital trip, I drove the Stork and the Mongoose down to the railway station,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:125855;left:108"><nobr>bought them the snacks they would need for their trip home, waited for the train to leave, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:125876;left:108"><nobr>then drove the car back, wiped it down, went to a nearby Hanuman temple to say a prayer of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:125897;left:108"><nobr>thanks, came back to my room and fell inside the mosquito net, dead tired.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:126256;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Get ready. You're going to drive me.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:126298;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Yes, madam,&quot; I said, rubbing my eyes. &quot;What time is it?&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:126381;left:108"><nobr>I put on a shirt, and then got the car out, and drove it to the front of the building. She had a bag in</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:126443;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Where to?&quot; I asked. It was two in the morning.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:126567;left:108"><nobr>I drove her to the airport, I asked no questions.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:126608;left:108"><nobr>When she got out at the airport, she pushed a brown envelope into my window—then slammed</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:126670;left:108"><nobr>And that was how, Your Excellency, my employer's marriage came to an end.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:126712;left:108"><nobr>Other drivers have techniques to prolong the marriages of their masters. One of them told me</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:126732;left:108"><nobr>that whenever the fighting got worse he drove fast, so they would get home quickly; whenever</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:126753;left:108"><nobr>they got romantic he let the car slow down. If they were shouting at each other he asked them for</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:126774;left:108"><nobr>directions; if they were kissing he turned the music up. I feel some part of the responsibility falls</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:126795;left:108"><nobr>on me, that their marriage broke up while I was the driver.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:126836;left:108"><nobr>The following morning, Mr. Ashok called me to the apartment. When I knocked on the door, he</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:126857;left:108"><nobr>caught me by the collar of my shirt and pulled me inside.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:126898;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Why didn't you tell me?&quot; he said, tightening his hold on the collar, almost choking me. &quot;Why</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:126919;left:108"><nobr>didn't you wake me up at once?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:126957;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Sir…she said…she said…she said…&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:127002;left:108"><nobr>He grabbed me and pushed me against the balcony of the apartment. The landlord inside him</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:127064;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Why did you drive her there, sister-fucker?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:127105;left:108"><nobr>I turned my head—behind me I saw all the shiny towers and shopping malls of Gurgaon.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:127548;left:108"><nobr>&quot;You can't blame me, sir!&quot; I shouted. &quot;I'd never heard of a woman leaving her husband for good!</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:127858;left:108"><nobr>I shoved the envelope under the bed: someone was coming toward my room. Four of the drivers</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:127962;left:108"><nobr>They took positions around me.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:128045;left:108"><nobr>&quot;The gatekeeper spilled the beans. There are no secrets around here. You drove the woman</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:128107;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I don't know what you're talking about.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:128148;left:108"><nobr>&quot;We know they've been fighting, Country-Mouse. And you drove her somewhere at night. The</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:128670;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Nothing, sir. I came to…make lunch.&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:128901;left:108"><nobr>went down and waited for the bell. At eight o'clock, I took the elevator up again. Pressing my ear</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:128922;left:108"><nobr>against the door, I listened.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:128964;left:108"><nobr>Nothing. Not a sound.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:129067;left:108"><nobr>The door was open. I walked in.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:129945;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Stop the car,&quot; he said.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:129986;left:108"><nobr>He opened the door of the car, put his hand on his stomach, bent down, and threw up on the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:130027;left:108"><nobr>traffic roared past us. I patted his back.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:130069;left:108"><nobr>&quot;You're drinking too much, sir.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:130110;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Why do men drink, Balram?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:130152;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I don't know, sir.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:130193;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Of course, in your caste you don't…Let me tell you, Balram. Men drink because they are sick of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:130214;left:108"><nobr>life. I thought caste and religion didn't matter any longer in today's world. My father said, 'No,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:130231;left:108"><nobr>don't marry her, she's of another…' I…&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:130276;left:108"><nobr>Mr. Ashok turned his head to the side, and I rubbed his back, thinking he might throw up again,</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:130334;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Sometimes I wonder, Balram. I wonder what's the point of living. I really wonder…&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:130379;left:108"><nobr><i>The point of living? </i>My heart pounded. <i>The point of your living is that if you die, who's going to</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:130400;left:108"><nobr><i>pay me three and a half thousand rupees a month?</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:130442;left:108"><nobr>&quot;You must believe in God, sir. You must go on. My granny says that if you believe in God, then</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:130462;left:108"><nobr>good things will happen.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:130503;left:108"><nobr>&quot;That's true, it's true. We must believe,&quot; he sobbed.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:130545;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Once there was a man who stopped believing in God, and you know what happened?&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:130628;left:108"><nobr>&quot;His buffalo died at once.&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:132445;left:108"><nobr>We were driving past a slum: one of those series of makeshift tents where the workers at some</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:132528;left:108"><nobr>My eyes obeyed his eyes. I saw the silhouettes of the slum dwellers close to one another inside</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:132569;left:108"><nobr>stove inside one tent, lit up by a golden lamp. The intimacy seemed so complete—so crushingly</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:132590;left:108"><nobr>complete. I understood what Mr. Ashok was going through.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:132631;left:108"><nobr>He lifted his hand—I prepared for his touch—but he wrapped it around the Mongoose's shoulder.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:132859;left:108"><nobr>During dinner, the Mongoose said, &quot;If you're getting depressed, Ashok, why don't you try yoga</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:132879;left:108"><nobr>and meditation? There's a yoga master on TV, and he's very good—this is what he does every</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:135274;left:108"><nobr>on this saddle were two metal troughs, filled to the brim with rubble. Behind this ass, two smaller</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:135295;left:108"><nobr>ones, of the same color, were also saddled with metal troughs full of rubble. These smaller asses</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:135315;left:108"><nobr>were walking slower, and the lead ass stopped often and turned to them, in a way that made you</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:135336;left:108"><nobr>think it was their mother.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:135378;left:108"><nobr>At once I knew what was troubling me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:135419;left:108"><nobr>I did not want to obey Kusum. She was blackmailing me; I understood why she had sent that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:135439;left:108"><nobr>letter through the Mongoose. If I refused, she would blow the whistle on me—tell Mr. Ashok I</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:137319;left:108"><nobr>All these changes happened in me because they happened first in Mr. Ashok. He returned from</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:137339;left:108"><nobr>America an innocent man, but life in Delhi corrupted him—and once the master of the Honda</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:137360;left:108"><nobr>City becomes corrupted, how can the driver stay innocent?</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:137401;left:108"><nobr>Now, I thought I knew Mr. Ashok, sir. But that's presumption on the part of any servant.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:137443;left:108"><nobr>The moment his brother left, he changed. He began wearing a black shirt with the top button</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:137505;left:108"><nobr>&quot;To the mall, sir?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:137546;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Yes.&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:137629;left:108"><nobr>But Mr. Ashok would not take the bait. He was punching the buttons of his cell phone and he</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:137650;left:108"><nobr>just grunted, &quot;Sahara Mall, Balram.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:137691;left:108"><nobr>&quot;That's the one Madam liked going to, sir.&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:137774;left:108"><nobr>I sat outside the mall and wondered what he was doing there. There was a flashing red light on</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:138364;left:108"><nobr>I closed my eyes; I shook my head. <i>What's happening to you tonight?</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:138405;left:108"><nobr>At this point, something took place that cleared my confusion—but also proved very</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:138426;left:108"><nobr>embarrassing to me and to Mr. Ashok. I had stopped the car at a traffic signal; a girl began</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:138447;left:108"><nobr>crossing the road in a tight T-shirt, her chest bobbing up and down like three kilograms of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:138468;left:108"><nobr>brinjals in a bag. I glanced at the rearview mirror—and there was Mr. Ashok, his eyes also</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:138488;left:108"><nobr>bobbing up and down.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:138530;left:108"><nobr>I thought, <i>Aha! Caught you, you rascal!</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:138571;left:108"><nobr>And his eyes shone, for he had seen <i>my </i>eyes, and he was thinking the exact same thing: <i>Aha!</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:138592;left:108"><nobr><i>Caught you, you rascal!</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:138633;left:108"><nobr>We had caught each other out.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:138716;left:108"><nobr>this mirror, it swings open like a door into a changing room, and the two of them have suddenly</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:138737;left:108"><nobr>caught each other naked?)</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:138778;left:108"><nobr>I was blushing. Mercifully, the light turned green, and I drove on.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:138819;left:108"><nobr>I swore not to look in the rearview mirror again that night. Now I understood why the city looked</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:138840;left:108"><nobr>so different—why my beak was getting stiff as I was driving.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:138882;left:108"><nobr>Because <i>he </i>was horny. And inside that sealed car, master and driver had somehow become one</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:140864;left:108"><nobr>you out, right? That's thirty years from now, Country-Mouse. If you save from today, you'll</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:140885;left:108"><nobr>make enough to buy a small home in some slum. If you've been a bit smarter and made a little</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:140906;left:108"><nobr>extra on the side, then you'll have enough to put your son in a good school. He can learn English,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:140926;left:108"><nobr>he can go to university. That's the best-case scenario. A house in a slum, a kid in college.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:140968;left:108"><nobr>&quot;<i>Best</i>-case?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:141009;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Well, on the other hand, you can get typhoid from bad water. Boss sacks you for no reason. You</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:141030;left:108"><nobr>get into an accident—plenty of worst-case scenarios.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:141071;left:108"><nobr>I was still pissing, but he put a hand on me. &quot;There's something I've got to ask you, Country-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:141092;left:108"><nobr>Mouse. Are you all right?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:141134;left:108"><nobr>I looked at him sideways. &quot;I'm fine. Why do you ask?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:141175;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I'm sorry to tell you this, but some of the drivers are talking about it openly. You sit by yourself</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:141192;left:108"><nobr>in your master's car the whole time, you talk to yourself…You know what you need? A woman.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:141216;left:108"><nobr>Have you seen the slum behind the malls? They're not bad-looking—nice and plump. Some of us</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:141237;left:108"><nobr>go there once a week. You can come too.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:141278;left:108"><nobr>&quot;DRIVER BALRAM, WHERE ARE YOU?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:141320;left:108"><nobr>It was the call from the microphone at the gate of the hotel. Mr. Turban was at the microphone—</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:141341;left:108"><nobr>speaking in the most pompous, stern voice possible: &quot;DRIVER BALRAM REPORT AT ONCE</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:141361;left:108"><nobr>TO THE DOOR. NO DELAY. YOUR MASTER WANTS YOU.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:141403;left:108"><nobr>I zipped up and ran, wiping my wet fingers on the back of my pants. </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:141742;left:108"><nobr>She was a slant-eyed one, with yellow skin. A foreigner. A Nepali. Not even of his caste or</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:141949;left:108"><nobr>on. He wanted to go to PVR Saket.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:141990;left:108"><nobr>Now, PVR Saket is the scene of a big cinema, which shows ten or twelve cinemas at the same</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:142052;left:108"><nobr>that sort of thing. A small bit of America in India.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:142094;left:108"><nobr>Beyond the last shining shop begins the second PVR. Every big market in Delhi is two markets</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:142114;left:108"><nobr>in one—there is always a smaller, grimier mirror image of the real market, tucked somewhere</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:142135;left:108"><nobr>into a by-lane.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:142176;left:108"><nobr>This is the market for the servants. I crossed over to this second PVR—a line of stinking</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:142197;left:108"><nobr>restaurants, tea stalls, and giant frying pans where bread was toasted in oil. The men who work in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:142218;left:108"><nobr>the cinemas, and who sweep them clean, come here to eat. The beggars have their homes here.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:142259;left:108"><nobr>I bought a tea and a potato <i>vada, </i>and sat under a banyan tree to eat.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:142301;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Brother, give me three rupees.&quot; An old woman, looking lean and miserable, with her hand</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:142322;left:108"><nobr>stretched out.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:142363;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I'm not one of the rich, mother—go to that side and ask them.&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:142487;left:108"><nobr>She went. A knife-grinder came and set up his stall right next to my tree. Holding two knives in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:142508;left:108"><nobr>his hand, he sat on his machine—it was one of the foot-pedaled whetstones—and began</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:142529;left:108"><nobr>pedaling. Sparks began buzzing a couple of inches away from me.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:143075;left:108"><nobr>A giant pile of old books lay in the center of the market, arranged in a large, hollow square, like</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:143095;left:108"><nobr>the mandala made at weddings to hold the sacred fire. A small man sat cross-legged on a stack of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:143116;left:108"><nobr>magazines in the center of the square of books, like the priest in charge of this mandala of print.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:143137;left:108"><nobr>The books drew me toward them like a big magnet, but as soon as he saw me, the man sitting on</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:143157;left:108"><nobr>the magazines snapped, &quot;All the books are in English.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:143199;left:108"><nobr>&quot;So?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:143240;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Do you read English?&quot; he barked.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:143282;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Do <i>you </i>read English?&quot; I retorted.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:143323;left:108"><nobr>There. That did it. Until then his tone of talking to me had been servant-to-servant; now it</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:143344;left:108"><nobr>became man-to-man. He stopped and looked me over from top to bottom.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:143385;left:108"><nobr>&quot;No,&quot; he said, breaking into a smile, as if he appreciated my balls.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:143427;left:108"><nobr>&quot;So how do you sell the books without knowing English?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:143468;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I know which book is what from the cover,&quot; he said. &quot;I know this one is Harry Potter.&quot; He</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:143489;left:108"><nobr>showed it to me. &quot;I know this one is James Hadley Chase.&quot; He picked it up. &quot;This is Kahlil</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:143510;left:108"><nobr>Gibran—this is Adolf Hitler—Desmond Bagley—<i>The Joy of Sex. </i>One time the publishers</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:143530;left:108"><nobr>changed the Hitler cover so it looked like Harry Potter, and life was hell for a week after that.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:143571;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I just want to stand around the books. I had a book once. When I was a boy.&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:143654;left:108"><nobr>So I stood around that big square of books. Standing around books, even books in a foreign</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:146722;left:441"><nobr>* * *</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:146761;left:108"><nobr>The next morning, he didn't come down or call me up to his room. I took the elevator, and stood</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:146781;left:108"><nobr>near the door. I was feeling guilty about what I'd done the previous night. I wondered if I should</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:146802;left:108"><nobr>make a full confession. I reached for the bell a few times, and then sighed and gave up.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:146843;left:108"><nobr>After a while, there were soft noises from inside. I put my ear to the wood and listened.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:146885;left:108"><nobr>&quot;But I <i>have </i>changed.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:146926;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Don't keep apologizing.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:146968;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I had more fun last evening than in four years of marriage.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:147009;left:108"><nobr>&quot;When you left for New York, I thought I'd never see you again. And now I have. That's the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:147030;left:108"><nobr>main thing for me.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:147071;left:108"><nobr>I turned away from the door and slapped my fist into my forehead. My guilt was growing by the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:147092;left:108"><nobr>minute. <i>She was his old lover, you fool—not some pickup!</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:147133;left:108"><nobr>Of course—he would never go for a slut. I had always known that he was a good man: a cut</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:147154;left:108"><nobr>above me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:147195;left:108"><nobr>I pinched my left palm as punishment.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:147237;left:108"><nobr>And put my ear to the door again.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:147278;left:108"><nobr>The phone began to ring from inside. Silence for a while, and then he said, &quot;That's Puddles. And</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:147299;left:108"><nobr>that's Cuddles. You remember them, don't you? They always bark for me. Here, take the phone,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:147316;left:108"><nobr>listen…&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:147361;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Bad news?&quot; Her voice, after a few minutes. &quot;You look upset.&quot; </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:147619;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I have to go see a cabinet minister. I hate doing that. They're all so <i>slimy</i>. The business I'm</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:147702;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Why don't you do something else, then? It was the same when they told you not to marry me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:147723;left:108"><nobr>You couldn't say no then either.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:147765;left:108"><nobr>&quot;It's not that simple, Uma. They're my father and brother.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:147806;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I wonder if you <i>have </i>changed, Ashok. The first call from Dhanbad, and you're back to your old</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:147868;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Look, let's not fight again. I'll send you back in the car now.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:147909;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Oh, no. I'm not going back with your driver. I know his kind, the village kind. They think that</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:147930;left:108"><nobr>any unmarried woman they see is a whore. And he probably thinks I'm a Nepali, because of my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:147951;left:108"><nobr>eyes. You know what that means for him. I'll go back on my own.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:147992;left:108"><nobr>&quot;This fellow is all right. He's part of the family.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:148034;left:108"><nobr>&quot;You shouldn't be so trusting, Ashok. Delhi drivers are all rotten. They sell drugs, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:148054;left:108"><nobr>prostitutes, and God knows what else.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:148096;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Not this one. He's stupid as hell, but he is honest. He'll drive you back.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:148137;left:108"><nobr>&quot;No, Ashok. I'll get a taxi. I'll call you in the evening?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:148179;left:108"><nobr>I realized that she was edging toward the door, and I turned and tiptoed away.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:148220;left:108"><nobr>There was no word from him until evening, and then he came down for the car. He made me go</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:148241;left:108"><nobr>from one bank to another bank. Sitting in the driver's seat, I watched through the corner of my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:148262;left:108"><nobr>eye; he was collecting money from the automatic cash machines—four different ones. Then he</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:148282;left:108"><nobr>said, &quot;Balram, go to the city. You know the big house that's on the Ashoka Road, where we went</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:148303;left:108"><nobr>to with Mukesh Sir once?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:148344;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Yes, sir. I remember. They've got two big Alsatian guard dogs, sir.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:148386;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Exactly. Your memory's good, Balram.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:148427;left:108"><nobr>I saw in the spy mirror that Mr. Ashok was pressing the buttons on his cell phone as I drove.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:148448;left:108"><nobr>Probably telling the minister's servant that he was coming with the cash. So now I understood at</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:148469;left:108"><nobr>last what work my master was doing as I drove him through Delhi.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:148510;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I'll be back in twenty minutes, Balram,&quot; Mr. Ashok said when we got to the minister's</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:148531;left:108"><nobr>bungalow. He stepped out with the red bag and slammed the door. </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:148807;left:108"><nobr>A security guard with a rifle sat in a metal booth over the red wall of the minister's house,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:148828;left:108"><nobr>watching me carefully. The two Alsatian dogs, roaming the compound, barked now and then.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:148870;left:108"><nobr>It was the hour of sunset. The birds of the city began to make a ruckus as they flew home. Now,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:148890;left:108"><nobr>Delhi, Mr. Premier, is a big city, but there are wild places in it—big parks, protected forests,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:148911;left:108"><nobr>stretches of wasteland—and things can suddenly come out of these wild places. As I was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:148932;left:108"><nobr>watching the red wall of the minister's house, a peacock flew up over the guard's booth and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:148953;left:108"><nobr>perched there; for an instant its deep blue neck and its long tail turned golden in the setting</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:148973;left:108"><nobr>sunlight. Then it vanished.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:149015;left:108"><nobr>In a little while it was night.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:149056;left:108"><nobr>The dogs began barking. The gate opened. Mr. Ashok came out of the minister's house with a fat</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:149077;left:108"><nobr>man—the same man who had come out that day from the President's House. I guessed that he</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:149097;left:108"><nobr>was the minister's assistant. They stopped in front of the car and talked.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:149139;left:108"><nobr>The fat man shook hands with Mr. Ashok, who was clearly eager to leave him—but ah, it isn't so</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:149160;left:108"><nobr>easy to let go of a politician—or even a politician's sidekick. I got out of the car, pretending to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:149180;left:108"><nobr>check the tires, and moved into eavesdropping distance.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:149222;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Don't worry, Ashok. I'll make sure the minister gives your father a call tomorrow.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:149263;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Thank you. My family appreciates your help.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:149304;left:108"><nobr>&quot;What are you doing after this?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:149346;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Nothing. Just going home to Gurgaon.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:149387;left:108"><nobr>&quot;A young man like you going home this early? Let's have some fun.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:149429;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Don't you have to work on the elections?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:149470;left:108"><nobr>&quot;The elections? All wrapped up. It's a landslide. The minister said so this morning. Elections, my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:149491;left:108"><nobr>friend, can be managed in India. It's not like in America.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:149532;left:108"><nobr>Brushing aside Mr. Ashok's protests, the fat man forced his way into the car. We had just started</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:149553;left:108"><nobr>down the road when he said, &quot;Ashok, let me have a whiskey.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:149594;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Here, in the car? I don't have any.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:149636;left:108"><nobr>The fat man seemed astonished. &quot;Everyone has whiskey in their car in Delhi, Ashok, didn't you</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:149657;left:108"><nobr>know this?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:149698;left:108"><nobr>He told me to go back to the minister's bungalow. He went inside and came back with a pair of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:149719;left:108"><nobr>glasses and a bottle. He slammed the door, breathed out, and said, &quot;Now this car is fully </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:150016;left:108"><nobr>Mr. Ashok took the bottle and got ready to pour the fat man a glass, when he smacked his lips in</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:150078;left:108"><nobr>I turned around at once and turned myself into a barman.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150120;left:108"><nobr>&quot;This driver is very talented,&quot; the fat man said. &quot;Sometimes they make a mess of pouring a</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:150182;left:108"><nobr>&quot;You'd never guess that his caste was a teetotaling one, would you?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150223;left:108"><nobr>I tightened the cap on the bottle and left it next to the gearbox. I heard the clinking of glasses</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150244;left:108"><nobr>behind me and two voices saying, &quot;Cheers!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150285;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Let's go,&quot; the minister's sidekick said. &quot;Let's go to the Sheraton, driver. There's a good</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150306;left:108"><nobr>restaurant down in the basement there, Ashok. Quiet place. We'll have some fun there.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150348;left:108"><nobr>I turned the ignition key and took the dark egg of the Honda City down the streets of New Delhi.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150389;left:108"><nobr>&quot;A man's car is a man's palace. I can't believe you've never done this.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150430;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Well, you'd never try it in America—would you?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150472;left:108"><nobr>&quot;That's the whole advantage of being in Delhi, dear boy!&quot; The fat man slapped Mr. Ashok's</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150492;left:108"><nobr>thigh.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150534;left:108"><nobr>He sipped, and said, &quot;What's your situation, Ashok?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150575;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Coal trading, these days. People think it's only technology that's booming. But coal—the media</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150596;left:108"><nobr>pays no attention to coal, does it? The Chinese are consuming coal like crazy and the price is</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150617;left:108"><nobr>going up everywhere. Millionaires are being made, left, right, and center.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150658;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Sure, sure,&quot; the fat man said. &quot;The China Effect.&quot; He sniffed his glass. &quot;But that's not what we</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150679;left:108"><nobr>in Delhi mean when we say <i>situation, </i>dear boy!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150720;left:108"><nobr>The minister's sidekick smiled. &quot;Basically, what I'm asking is, who services you—down <i>there</i>?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150741;left:108"><nobr>He pointed at a part of Mr. Ashok's body that he had no business pointing at.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150782;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I am separated. Going through a divorce.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150824;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I'm sorry to hear that,&quot; the fat man said. &quot;Marriage is a good institution. Everything's coming</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150845;left:108"><nobr>apart in this country. Families, marriages—everything.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:150886;left:108"><nobr>He sipped some more whiskey and said, &quot;Tell me, Ashok, do you think there will be a civil war</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:151183;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Why do you say that?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:151225;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Four days ago, I was in a court in Ghaziabad. The judge gave an order that the lawyers didn't</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:151246;left:108"><nobr>like, and they simply refused to accept his order. They went mad—they dragged the judge down</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:151266;left:108"><nobr>and beat him, in his own court. The matter was not reported in the press. But I saw it with my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:151287;left:108"><nobr>own eyes. If people start beating the judges—in their own courtrooms—then what is the future</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:151308;left:108"><nobr>for our country?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:151349;left:108"><nobr>Something icy cold touched my neck. The fat man was rubbing me with his glass.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:151391;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Another drink, driver.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:151432;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:151473;left:108"><nobr>Have you ever seen this trick, Your Excellency? A man steering the car with one hand, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:151494;left:108"><nobr>picking up a whiskey bottle with the other hand, hauling it over his shoulder, then pouring it into</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:151515;left:108"><nobr>a glass, even as the car is moving, without spilling a drop! The skills required of an Indian</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:151536;left:108"><nobr>driver! Not only does he have to have perfect reflexes, night vision, and infinite patience, he also</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:151556;left:108"><nobr>has to be the consummate barman!</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:151598;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Would you like some more, sir?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:151639;left:108"><nobr>I glanced at the minister's sidekick, at the fat, corrupt folds of flesh under his chin—then glanced</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:151660;left:108"><nobr>at the road to make sure I wasn't driving into anything.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:151701;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Pour one for your master now.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:151743;left:108"><nobr>&quot;No, I don't drink much, really. I'm fine.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:151784;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Don't be silly, Ashok. I insist—fellow, pour one for your master.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:151826;left:108"><nobr>So I had to turn and do the amazing one-hand-on-the-wheel-one-hand-with-the-whiskey-bottle</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:151846;left:108"><nobr>trick all over again.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:151887;left:108"><nobr>The fat man went quiet after the second drink. He wiped his lips.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:151929;left:108"><nobr>&quot;When you were in America you must have had a lot of women? I mean—the <i>local </i>women.&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:152724;left:108"><nobr>The fat man took out his cell phone and punched some numbers. The light of the phone made a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:152744;left:108"><nobr>blue halo on his face.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:152786;left:108"><nobr>&quot;She's there right now. Let's go see her. She's a stunner, I tell you. Just like that American</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:152806;left:108"><nobr>actress. Do you have thirty thousand on you?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:152848;left:108"><nobr>&quot;No. Listen. I'm seeing someone. I'm not—&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:152889;left:108"><nobr>&quot;No problem. I'll pay now. You can pay later. Just put it into the next envelope you give the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:152910;left:108"><nobr>minister.&quot; He put his hand on Mr. Ashok's hand and winked, then leaned over and gave</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:152931;left:108"><nobr>instructions to me. I looked at Mr. Ashok in the rearview mirror as hard as I could.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:152972;left:108"><nobr><i>A whore? That's for people like me, sir. Are you sure you want this?</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:153014;left:108"><nobr>I wish I could have told him this openly—but who was I? Just the driver.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:153055;left:108"><nobr>I took orders from the fat man. Mr. Ashok said nothing—just sat there sucking his whiskey like a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:153075;left:108"><nobr>boy with a soda. Maybe he thought it was a joke, or maybe he was too frightened of the fat man</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:153096;left:108"><nobr>to say no.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:153138;left:108"><nobr>But I will defend his honor to my deathbed. <i>They </i>corrupted him.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:153179;left:108"><nobr>The fat man made me drive to a place in Greater Kailash—another housing colony where people</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:153200;left:108"><nobr>of quality live in Delhi. Touching my neck with his icy glass when I had to make a turn, he</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:153221;left:108"><nobr>guided me to the place. It was as large as a small palace, with big white columns of marble up</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:153241;left:108"><nobr>the front. From the amount of garbage thrown outside the walls of the house, you knew that rich</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:153262;left:108"><nobr>people lived here. </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:153808;left:108"><nobr>though, I didn't know. It's only when I came to Bangalore and mastered the use of the Internet—</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:153829;left:108"><nobr>in just two quick sessions, mind you!—that I found her photo and name on Google.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:153870;left:108"><nobr>Kim Basinger.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:153912;left:108"><nobr>That was the name the fat man had mentioned. And it was true—the girl who got in with the fat</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:153932;left:108"><nobr>man did look exactly like Kim Basinger! She was tall and beautiful, but the most remarkable</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:153953;left:108"><nobr>thing about her was her hair—golden and glossy, just like in the shampoo advertisements!</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:153994;left:108"><nobr>&quot;How are you, Ashok?&quot; She said it in perfect Hindi. She put her hand out and took Mr. Ashok's</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:154056;left:108"><nobr>The minister's assistant chuckled. &quot;There. India has progressed, hasn't it? She's speaking in</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:154119;left:108"><nobr>He slapped her on the thigh. &quot;Your Hindi has improved, dear.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:154160;left:108"><nobr>Mr. Ashok leaned back to speak to the fat man over her shoulder. &quot;Is she Russian?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:154202;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Ask her, don't ask me, Ashok. Don't be shy. She's a friend.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:154243;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Ukrainian,&quot; she said in her accented Hindi. &quot;I am a Ukrainian student in India.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:154284;left:108"><nobr>I thought: I would have to remember this place, Ukraine. And one day I would have to go there!</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:154326;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Ashok,&quot; the fat man said. &quot;Go on, touch her hair. It's real. Don't be scared—she's a friend.&quot; He</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:158457;left:108"><nobr>with me. On Mr. Ashok's privacy I allowed no one to infringe.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:158498;left:108"><nobr>I was standing just a few feet from Vitiligo-Lips, with my master's bottle of mineral water in my</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:158560;left:108"><nobr>Mr. Ashok was about to complete his circle—I could smell his sweat coming toward me. This</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:158581;left:108"><nobr>was round number three for him. He took the bottle, drained it, wiped his face with his towel,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:158601;left:108"><nobr>and draped it back on my shoulder.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:158643;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I'm done, Balram. Bring the towel and bottle up, okay?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:158684;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; I said, and watched him go into the apartment block. He took a walk once or twice a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:158705;left:108"><nobr>week, but it clearly wasn't enough to counter his nights of debauchery—I saw a big, wet paunch</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:158726;left:108"><nobr>pressing against his white T-shirt. How repulsive he was, these days.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:158767;left:108"><nobr>I signaled to Vitiligo-Lips before going down to the parking lot.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:158808;left:108"><nobr>Ten minutes later, I smelled the steel man's sweat and heard footsteps. Vitiligo-Lips had come</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:158829;left:108"><nobr>down. I called him over to the Honda City—it was the only place in the world I felt fully safe</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:158850;left:108"><nobr>anymore.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:158891;left:108"><nobr>&quot;What is it, Country-Mouse? Want another magazine?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:158933;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Not that. Something else.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:158974;left:108"><nobr>I got down on my haunches; I squatted by one of the tires of the City. I scraped the grooves of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:158995;left:108"><nobr>the tire with a fingernail. He squatted too.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:159036;left:108"><nobr>I showed him the strand of golden hair—I kept it tied around my wrist, like a locket. He brought</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:159057;left:108"><nobr>my wrist to his nose—he rubbed the strand between his fingers, sniffed it, and let my wrist down.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:159098;left:108"><nobr>&quot;No problem.&quot; He winked. &quot;I told you your master would get lonely.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:159140;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Don't talk about him!&quot; I seized his neck. He shook me off.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:159181;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Are you crazy? You tried to choke me!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:159223;left:108"><nobr>I scraped the grooves of the tire again. &quot;How much will it cost?&quot; </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:160178;left:108"><nobr>2. When his master orders him to make a repair to the car, he can go to a corrupt mechanic; the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:160199;left:108"><nobr>mechanic will inflate the price of the repair, and the driver will receive a cut. This is a list of a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:160220;left:108"><nobr>few entrepreneurial mechanics who help entrepreneurial drivers:</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:160261;left:108"><nobr>Lucky Mechanics, in Lado Serai, near the Qutub</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:160364;left:108"><nobr>are the ways in which I can benefit from his carelessness?&quot; For instance, if his master leaves</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:160385;left:108"><nobr>empty English liquor bottles lying around in the car, he can sell the whiskey bottles to the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:161081;left:108"><nobr>Over the next two weeks, I did things I am still ashamed to admit. I cheated my employer. I</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:161122;left:108"><nobr>necessary; and three times, while driving back to Buckingham B, I picked up a paying customer.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:161164;left:108"><nobr>The strangest thing was that each time I looked at the cash I had made by cheating him, instead</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:161371;left:108"><nobr>Then one Sunday afternoon, when Mr. Ashok had said he wouldn't need me again that day, I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:161391;left:108"><nobr>gulped two big glasses of whiskey for courage, then went to the servants' dormitory. Vitiligo-</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:164479;left:108"><nobr>&quot;That's right. But it's my name,&quot; I said. &quot;My family gave me no other name.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:164521;left:108"><nobr>She began laughing—a high-pitched, silvery laugh that made her whole golden head of hair bob</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:164541;left:108"><nobr>up and down. My heart beat like a horse's. Her perfume went straight to my brain.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:164583;left:108"><nobr>&quot;You know, when I was young, I was given a name in my language that just meant 'girl.' My</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:164604;left:108"><nobr>family did the same thing to me!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:164645;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Wow,&quot; I said, curling my legs up on the bed.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:164686;left:108"><nobr>We talked. She told me she hated the mosquitoes in this hotel and the manager, and I nodded.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:164707;left:108"><nobr>We talked for a while like this, and then she said, &quot;You're not a bad-looking fellow—and you're</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:164728;left:108"><nobr>quite sweet,&quot; and then ran her finger through my hair.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:164769;left:108"><nobr>At this point, I jumped out of the bed. I said, &quot;Why are you here, sister? If you want to leave this</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:164790;left:108"><nobr>hotel, why don't you? Don't worry about the manager. I'm here to protect you! I am your own</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:164811;left:108"><nobr>brother, Balram Halwai!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:164852;left:108"><nobr>Sure, I said that—in the Hindi film they'll make of my life.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:164894;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Seven thousand sweet rupees for twenty minutes! Time to get started!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:164935;left:108"><nobr>That was what I actually said.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:164976;left:108"><nobr>I climbed on top of her—and held her arms behind her head with one hand. Time to dip my beak</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:164997;left:108"><nobr>in her. I let the other hand run through her golden curls.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:165038;left:108"><nobr>And then I shrieked. I could not have shrieked louder if you had shown me a lizard.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:165080;left:108"><nobr>&quot;What happened, Munna?&quot; she asked.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:165121;left:108"><nobr>I jumped off the bed, and <i>slapped </i>her.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:165163;left:108"><nobr>My, these foreigners can yell when they want to. </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:165439;left:108"><nobr>Immediately—as if the manager had been there all the time, his ear to the door, grinning—the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:165502;left:108"><nobr>&quot;This,&quot; I shouted at him, pulling the girl by her hair, &quot;is not real gold.&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:165626;left:108"><nobr>I leapt at him, caught his chin in my hand, and rammed it against the door. &quot;I want my money</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:165688;left:108"><nobr>The woman let out a scream from behind me. I turned around—that was the mistake I made. I</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:165750;left:108"><nobr>Ten minutes later, with a scratched and bruised face, I came tumbling out the front door. It</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:165812;left:108"><nobr>Vitiligo-Lips hadn't waited. I had to take a bus back home; I was rubbing my head the whole</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:165854;left:108"><nobr><i>could have bought for that much money?</i>—I could feel Granny's fingers wringing my ears.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:165895;left:108"><nobr>Back in Buckingham Towers at last—after a one-hour traffic jam on the road—I washed the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:165936;left:108"><nobr>scratched my groin. I needed that. I slouched toward my room, kicked opened the door, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:165957;left:108"><nobr>froze.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:165999;left:108"><nobr>Someone was inside the mosquito net. I saw a silhouette in the lotus position.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:166040;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Don't worry, Balram. I know what you were doing.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:166082;left:108"><nobr>A man's voice. Well, at least it wasn't Granny—that was my first thought.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:166123;left:108"><nobr>Mr. Ashok lifted up a corner of the net and looked at me, a sly grin on his face.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:166164;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I know exactly what you were doing.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:166206;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Sir?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:166247;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I was calling your name and you weren't responding. So I came down to see. But I know exactly</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:166264;left:108"><nobr>what you were doing…that other driver, the man with pink lips, he told me.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:166309;left:108"><nobr>My heart pounded. I looked down at the ground.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:166351;left:108"><nobr>&quot;He said you were at the temple, offering prayers for my health.&quot; </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:166627;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; I said, with sweat pouring down my face in relief. &quot;That's right, sir.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:166669;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Come inside the net,&quot; he said softly. I went in and sat next to him inside the mosquito net. He</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:166731;left:108"><nobr>&quot;You live in such a hole, Balram. I never knew. I'm sorry.&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:166914;left:108"><nobr>&quot;No, sir…it's a skin disease. I've got it here too, behind my ear—see—all those pink spots?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:166959;left:108"><nobr>He came close, filling my nostrils with his perfume. Bending my ear with a finger, gently, he</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:167021;left:108"><nobr>&quot;My. I never noticed. I sit behind you every day and I never—&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:167062;left:108"><nobr>&quot;A lot of people have this disease, sir. A lot of poor people.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:167104;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Really. I haven't noticed. Can you get it treated?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:167145;left:108"><nobr>&quot;No, sir. The diseases of the poor can never get treated. My father had TB and it killed him.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:167187;left:108"><nobr>&quot;It's the twenty-first century, Balram. Anything can be treated. You go to the hospital and get it</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:167245;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; I said. &quot;Sir…do you want me to take you somewhere in the City?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:167290;left:108"><nobr>He opened his lips and then closed them without making any noise. He did this a couple of times,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:167311;left:108"><nobr>and then he said, &quot;My way of living is all wrong, Balram. I know it, but I don't have the courage</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:167328;left:108"><nobr>to change it. I just don't have…the <i>balls.</i>&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:167373;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Don't think so much about it, sir. And sir, let's go upstairs, I beg you. This is not a place for a</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:167431;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I let people exploit me, Balram. I've never done what I've wanted, my whole life. I…&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:170544;left:108"><nobr>&quot;The other day I was speaking to our accountant and he was saying, 'Sir, you have no money in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:170564;left:108"><nobr>your bank. It's all gone.' Do you know how high the taxes are in this country?&quot; the younger thug</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:170585;left:108"><nobr>said. &quot;If we gave any money, what would we have to eat?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:170626;left:108"><nobr>That was when it struck me that there really was no difference between the two of them. They</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:170647;left:108"><nobr>were both their father's seed.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:170688;left:108"><nobr>For the rest of the drive home, the Mongoose pointedly kept his eyes on the rearview mirror. He</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:170709;left:108"><nobr>looked as if he had smelled something funny.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:170751;left:108"><nobr>When we reached Buckingham B, he said, &quot;Come upstairs, Balram.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:170792;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:170834;left:108"><nobr>We stood side by side in the elevator. When he opened the door of the apartment, he pointed to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:170854;left:108"><nobr>the floor. &quot;Make yourself comfortable.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:170895;left:108"><nobr>I squatted below the photo of Cuddles and Puddles and put my hands between my knees. He sat</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:170916;left:108"><nobr>down on a chair, and rested his face in his palm, and just stared at me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:170958;left:108"><nobr>His brow was furrowed. I could see a thought forming in his mind.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:170999;left:108"><nobr>He got up from his chair, walked over to where I was crouched, and got down on one knee. He</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:171020;left:108"><nobr>sniffed the air.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:171061;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Your breath smells of aniseed.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:171103;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:171504;left:108"><nobr>I took in a big breath; held it in the pit of my belly; then I forced it out, in a belch, right to his</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:171566;left:108"><nobr>&quot;That's disgusting, Balram,&quot; he said with a look of horror. He stood up and took two steps back.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:171732;left:108"><nobr>The next day, I drove him and Mr. Ashok to some minister's or bureaucrat's house in New Delhi;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:171752;left:108"><nobr>they went out with the red bag. Afterwards, I took them to a hotel, where they had lunch—I gave</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:171773;left:108"><nobr>the hotel staff instructions: no potatoes in the food—then drove the Mongoose to the railway</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:171794;left:108"><nobr>station.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:171835;left:108"><nobr>I put up with his usual threats and warnings—no A/C, no music, no wasting fuel, blah blah blah.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:171856;left:108"><nobr>I stood on the platform and watched as he ate his snack. When the train left, I danced around the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:171876;left:108"><nobr>platform and clapped my hands. Two homeless urchins were watching me, and they laughed—</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:171897;left:108"><nobr>they clapped their hands too. One of them began singing a song from the latest Hindi film, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:171918;left:108"><nobr>we danced together on the platform.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:171959;left:108"><nobr>Next morning, I was in the apartment, and Mr. Ashok was fiddling with the red bag and getting</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:172022;left:108"><nobr>I said, &quot;I'll take the bag down, sir. I'll wait in the car.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:172063;left:108"><nobr>He hesitated, then held the bag out in my direction. &quot;I'll join you in a minute.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:172104;left:108"><nobr>I closed the door of the apartment. I walked to the elevator, pressed the button, and waited. It was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:172125;left:108"><nobr>a heavy bag, and I had to shift it about in my palm.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:172166;left:108"><nobr>The elevator had reached the fourth floor.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:172208;left:108"><nobr>I turned and looked at the view from the balcony of the thirteenth floor—the lights were shining</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:172229;left:108"><nobr>from Gurgaon's malls, even in broad daylight. A new mall had opened in the past week. Another</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:172249;left:108"><nobr>one was under construction. The city was growing.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:172291;left:108"><nobr>The elevator was coming up fast. It was about to reach the eleventh floor. </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:172920;left:108"><nobr>At a red light, I looked at the rearview mirror. I saw my thick mustache and my jaw. I touched</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:172940;left:108"><nobr>the mirror. The angle of the image changed. Now I saw long beautiful eyebrows curving on</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:172961;left:108"><nobr>either side of powerful, furrowed brow muscles; black eyes were shining below those tensed</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:172982;left:108"><nobr>muscles. The eyes of a cat watching its prey.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:173271;left:108"><nobr>&quot;What is it, Balram? Did you say something?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:173313;left:108"><nobr>I tapped the mirror. My mustache rose into view again, and the eyes disappeared, and it was only</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:173375;left:108"><nobr>&quot;This fellow in front of me is driving rashly, sir. I was just grumbling.&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:174410;left:108"><nobr>Instead of parking the car, I drove to the train station, which is in Pahar Ganj, not far from the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:175171;left:108"><nobr>The machine comes to life; levers start to move inside, things go clankety-clank, and the lights</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:175192;left:108"><nobr>flash like crazy. Then there is a loud noise, and a small stiff chit of cardboard colored either</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:175213;left:108"><nobr>green or yellow will pop out of the machine. The lights and noise calm down. On this chit will be</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:175275;left:108"><nobr>Two kinds of people use these machines: the children of the rich, or the fully grown adults of the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:176504;left:108"><nobr>attempt to gnaw at the wound. The wound was just out of reach of its teeth, but the dog was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:176525;left:108"><nobr>going crazy from pain—trying to attack the wound with its slavering mouth, it kept moving in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:176546;left:108"><nobr>mad, precise, pointless circles.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:176587;left:108"><nobr>I looked at the sleeping woman—at her heaving breasts. Behind me the growling went on and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:176608;left:108"><nobr>on.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:176649;left:108"><nobr>That Sunday, I took Mr. Ashok's permission, saying I wanted to go to a temple, and went into the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:176670;left:108"><nobr>city. I took a bus down to Qutub, and from there a jeep-taxi down to G.B. Road.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:176711;left:108"><nobr>This, Mr. Premier, is the famous &quot;red-light district&quot; (as they say in English) of Delhi.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:176753;left:108"><nobr>An hour here would clear all the evil thoughts out of my head. When you retain semen in your</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:176774;left:108"><nobr>lower body, it leads to evil movements in the fluids of your upper body. In the Darkness we</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:176794;left:108"><nobr>know this to be a fact.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:176835;left:108"><nobr>It was just five o'clock and still light, but the women were waiting for me, as they wait for all</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:176856;left:108"><nobr>men, at all times of the day.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:176898;left:108"><nobr>Now, I've been to these streets before—as I've confessed to you—but this time was different. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:176918;left:108"><nobr>heard them above me—the women—jeering and taunting from the grilled windows of the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:176939;left:108"><nobr>brothels—but this time I couldn't bear to look up at them.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:176981;left:108"><nobr>A <i>paan</i>-maker sat on a wooden stall outside the gaudy blue door of a brothel, using a knife to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:177001;left:108"><nobr>spread spices on moist leaves that he had picked out of a bowl of water, which is the first step in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:177022;left:108"><nobr>the preparation of <i>paan; </i>in the small square space below his stall sat another man, boiling milk in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:177043;left:108"><nobr>a vessel over the hissing blue flame of a gas stove. </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:177527;left:108"><nobr>The Nepalis up there, behind the barred window, were really good-looking: very light-skinned</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:177547;left:108"><nobr>and with those Chinese eyes that just drive us Indian men mad. I shook the pimp's hand off my</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:177609;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Take any one! Take all! Aren't you man enough, son?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:177651;left:108"><nobr>Normally this would have been enough for me to burst into the brothel, hollering for blood.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:177692;left:108"><nobr>But sometimes what is most animal in a man may be the best thing in him. From my waist down,</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:177879;left:108"><nobr>I watched the milk. It seethed, and spilled down the sides of the stainless steel vessel; the small,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:177899;left:108"><nobr>shrunken man smiled—he provoked the boiling milk with a spoon—it became frothier and</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:177962;left:108"><nobr>I charged into the <i>paan</i>-seller, pushing him off his perch, scattering his leaves, and spilling his</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:178003;left:108"><nobr>shoving and kicking for dear life, I ran out of that street.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:178044;left:108"><nobr>Now, G.B. Road is in Old Delhi, about which I should say something. Remember, Mr. Premier,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:178065;left:108"><nobr>that Delhi is the capital of not one but <i>two </i>countries—two Indias. The Light and the Darkness</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:178086;left:108"><nobr>both flow into Delhi. Gurgaon, where Mr. Ashok lived, is the bright, modern end of the city, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:178106;left:108"><nobr>this place, Old Delhi, is the other end. Full of things the modern world forgot all about—</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:178127;left:108"><nobr>rickshaws, old stone buildings, the Muslims. On a Sunday, though, there is something more: if</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:178148;left:108"><nobr>you keep pushing through the crowd that is always there, go past the men cleaning the other</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:178169;left:108"><nobr>men's ears by poking rusty metal rods into them, past the men selling small fish trapped in green</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:178189;left:108"><nobr>bottles full of brine, past the cheap shoe market and the cheap shirt market, you will come to the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:178528;left:108"><nobr>Pleasure, Philosophy, Education, and Foreign Countries—heaped upon the pavement from Delhi</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:178818;left:108"><nobr>&quot;It's no good,&quot; I would say, and put the book down and go to the next bookseller, and pick up</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:178901;left:108"><nobr>Some books were in Urdu, the language of the Muslims—which is all just scratches and dots, as</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:179087;left:108"><nobr>He opened the book, cleared his throat, and read, &quot;<i>'You were looking for the key for years.'</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:179108;left:108"><nobr>Understood that?&quot; He looked at me, wide furrows on his black forehead.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:179150;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Yes, Muslim uncle.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:179191;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Shut up, you liar. And listen.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:179232;left:108"><nobr>He cleared his throat again.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:179357;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Please, Muslim uncle,&quot; I begged. &quot;I'm just a rickshaw-puller's son from the Darkness. Tell me</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:179778;left:108"><nobr>ten-thousand-year war of brains between the rich and the poor. Each side is eternally trying to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:179799;left:108"><nobr>hoodwink the other side: and it has been this way since the start of time. The poor win a few</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:179820;left:108"><nobr>battles (the peeing in the potted plants, the kicking of the pet dogs, etc.) but of course the rich</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:179841;left:108"><nobr>have won the war for ten thousand years. That's why, one day, some wise men, out of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:179861;left:108"><nobr>compassion for the poor, left them signs and symbols in poems, which appear to be about roses</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:179882;left:108"><nobr>and pretty girls and things like that, but when understood correctly spill out secrets that allow the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:179903;left:108"><nobr>poorest man on earth to conclude the ten-thousand-year-old brain-war on terms favorable to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:179923;left:108"><nobr>himself. Now, the four greatest of these wise poets were Rumi, Iqbal, Mirza Ghalib, and another</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:180048;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Muslim uncle, I have another question for you.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:180089;left:108"><nobr>&quot;What do I look like? Your schoolteacher? Don't keep asking me questions.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:180130;left:108"><nobr>&quot;The last one, I promise. Tell me, Muslim uncle, can a man make himself vanish with poetry?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:180172;left:108"><nobr>&quot;What do you mean—like vanish through black magic?&quot; He looked at me. &quot;Yes, that can be</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:180192;left:108"><nobr>done. There are books for that. You want to buy one?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:180230;left:108"><nobr>&quot;No, not vanish like that. I meant can he…can he…&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:180275;left:108"><nobr>The bookseller had narrowed his eyes. The sweat beads had grown larger on his huge black</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:180379;left:108"><nobr>And then I warned myself never to talk to this old man again. He knew too much already.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:180420;left:108"><nobr>My eyes were burning from squinting at books. I should have been heading back toward Delhi</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:180441;left:108"><nobr>Gate to catch a bus. There was a foul taste of book in my mouth—as if I had inhaled so much</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:180462;left:108"><nobr>particulated old paper from the air. Strange thoughts brew in your heart when you spend too</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:181091;left:108"><nobr>hairs still stuck out, like last defiant bits of the personality of the dead buffalo. The rest of the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:181215;left:108"><nobr>I walked along with that poor animal for a while, staring at the dead, stripped faces of the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:181256;left:108"><nobr>pulling the cart turned its face to me, and said in a voice not unlike my father's:</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:181339;left:108"><nobr>It was like experiencing a nightmare in the minutes before you wake up; you know it's a dream,</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:183467;left:108"><nobr>Early next morning I walked out of Buckingham B onto the main road. Though it was a brand-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:183487;left:108"><nobr>new building, there was already a leak in the drainage pipe, and a large patch of sewage</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:183508;left:108"><nobr>darkened the earth outside the compound wall; three stray dogs were sleeping on the wet patch.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:183529;left:108"><nobr>A good way to cool off—summer had started, and even the nights were unpleasant now.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:183570;left:108"><nobr>The three mutts seemed so comfortable. I got down on my haunches and watched them.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:183612;left:108"><nobr>I put my finger on the dark sewage puddle. So cool, so tempting.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:183653;left:108"><nobr>One of the stray dogs woke up; it yawned and showed me all its canines. It sprang to its feet. The</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:183674;left:108"><nobr>other mutts got up too. A growling began, and a scratching of the wet mud, and a showing of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:183694;left:108"><nobr>teeth—they wanted me off their kingdom.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:183736;left:108"><nobr>I surrendered the sewage to the dogs and headed for the malls. None of them had opened yet. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:183756;left:108"><nobr>sat down on the pavement.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:183798;left:108"><nobr>No idea where to go next.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:183839;left:108"><nobr>That's when I saw the small dark marks in the pavement.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:183881;left:108"><nobr>Paw prints.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:183922;left:108"><nobr>An animal had walked on the concrete before it had set.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:183963;left:108"><nobr>I got up and walked after the animal. The space between the prints grew wider—the animal had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:183984;left:108"><nobr>begun to sprint.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:184026;left:108"><nobr>I walked faster.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:184067;left:108"><nobr>The paw prints of the accelerating animal went all the way around the malls, and then behind the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:184088;left:108"><nobr>malls, and at last, where the pavement ended and raw earth began, they vanished.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:184129;left:108"><nobr>Here I had to stop, because five feet ahead of me a row of men squatted on the ground in a nearly</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:184427;left:108"><nobr>I was at the slum.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:184468;left:108"><nobr>Vitiligo-Lips had told me about this place—all these construction workers who were building the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:184489;left:108"><nobr>malls and giant apartment buildings lived here. They were from a village in the Darkness; they</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:184510;left:108"><nobr>did not like outsiders coming in, except for those who had business after dark. The men were</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:184530;left:108"><nobr>defecating in the open like a defensive wall in front of the slum: making a line that no</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:184551;left:108"><nobr>respectable human should cross. The wind wafted the stench of fresh shit toward me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:184593;left:108"><nobr>I found a gap in the line of the defecators. They squatted there like stone statues.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:184634;left:108"><nobr>These people were building homes for the rich, but they lived in tents covered with blue</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:184655;left:108"><nobr>tarpaulin sheets, and partitioned into lanes by lines of sewage. It was even worse than</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:184675;left:108"><nobr>Laxmangarh. I picked my way around the broken glass, wire, and shattered tube lights. The</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:184696;left:108"><nobr>stench of feces was replaced by the stronger stench of industrial sewage. The slum ended in an</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:184717;left:108"><nobr>open sewer—a small river of black water went sluggishly past me, bubbles sparkling in it and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:184737;left:108"><nobr>little circles spreading on its surface. Two children were splashing about in the black water.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:184779;left:108"><nobr>A hundred-rupee note came flying down into the river. The children watched with open mouths,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:184800;left:108"><nobr>and then ran to catch the note before it floated away. One child caught it, and then the other</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:184820;left:108"><nobr>began hitting him, and they began to tumble about in the black water as they fought.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:184862;left:108"><nobr>I went back to the line of crappers. One of them had finished up and left, but his position had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:184882;left:108"><nobr>been filled.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:184924;left:108"><nobr>I squatted down with them and grinned.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:184965;left:108"><nobr>A few immediately turned their eyes away: they were still human beings. Some stared at me</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:184986;left:108"><nobr>blankly as if shame no longer mattered to them. And then I saw one fellow, a thin black fellow,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:185007;left:108"><nobr>was grinning back at me, as if he were proud of what he was doing.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:185048;left:108"><nobr>Still crouching, I moved myself over to where he was squatting and faced him. I smiled as wide</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:185069;left:108"><nobr>as I could. So did he.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:185110;left:108"><nobr>He began to laugh—and I began to laugh—and then all the crappers laughed together.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:185151;left:108"><nobr>&quot;We'll take care of your wedding expenses,&quot; I shouted.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:185193;left:108"><nobr>&quot;We'll take care of your wedding expenses!&quot; he shouted back.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:185317;left:108"><nobr>He began laughing—laughing so violently that he fell down face-first into the ground, still</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:185338;left:108"><nobr>laughing, exposing his stained arse to the stained sky of Delhi. </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:187569;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Let's see what you learned in five years. Do you know the eight-times table?&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:187652;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Let's hear it.&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:188094;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Order me a tea too, won't you?&quot; Vitiligo-Lips sat down next to me. He smiled at Dharam.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:188177;left:108"><nobr>He pouted. &quot;Is that any way for you to be talking to me, working-class hero?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:188219;left:108"><nobr>Dharam was watching us keenly, so I said, &quot;This boy is from my village. From my family. I'm</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:188364;left:108"><nobr>He flexed his palm near my face—five fingers. That meant, <i>I want five hundred rupees.</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:188405;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I've got nothing.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:188446;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Eight fours are thirty-two.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:188488;left:108"><nobr>He drew a line across his neck and smiled. <i>Your master will know everything.</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:188529;left:108"><nobr>&quot;What's your name, boy?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:188571;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Dharam.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:188612;left:108"><nobr>&quot;What a nice name. Do you know what it means?&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:188695;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Does your uncle know what it means?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:188736;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Shut up,&quot; I said.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:188778;left:108"><nobr>It was the time of the day when the tea shop got cleaned. One of the human spiders dropped a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:188798;left:108"><nobr>wet rag on the floor and started to crawl with it, pushing a growing wavelet of stinking ink-black</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:188819;left:108"><nobr>water ahead of him. Even the mice scampered out of the shop. The customers sitting at the tables</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:188840;left:108"><nobr>were not spared—the black puddle splashed them as it passed. Bits of <i>beedis, </i>shiny plastic</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:188861;left:108"><nobr>wrappers, punched bus tickets, snippets of onion, sprigs of fresh coriander floated on the black</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:188881;left:108"><nobr>water; the reflection of a naked electric bulb shone out of the scum like a yellow gemstone.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:189303;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Turn on the light, you fool! Turn on the light!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:189345;left:108"><nobr>He did so, and saw me paralyzed inside the net: I could not even point at the thing. A thick-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:189365;left:108"><nobr>bodied gray gecko had come down from the wall and was on my bed.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:189407;left:108"><nobr>Dharam began to grin.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:189448;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I'm not joking, you moron—get it out of my bed!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:189489;left:108"><nobr>He stuck his hand into the net, grabbed the lizard, and smashed it under his foot.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:189531;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Throw it somewhere far, far away—outside the room, outside the apartment building.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:189572;left:108"><nobr>I saw the bewildered look in his eyes: <i>Afraid of a lizard—a grown man like my uncle!</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:189614;left:108"><nobr><i>Good, </i>I thought, just as he was turning off the lights. <i>He'll never suspect that I'm planning</i></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:189676;left:108"><nobr>An instant later, my grin faded.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:189759;left:108"><nobr>I began to sweat. I stared at the anonymous palm prints that had been pressed into the white</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:189821;left:108"><nobr>A cane began tapping on concrete—the night watchman of Buckingham B was doing his rounds</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:189842;left:108"><nobr>with his long cane. When the tapping of the cane died out there was no noise inside the room,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:189862;left:108"><nobr>except for the buzzing of the roaches as they chewed on the walls or flew about. It was another</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:189883;left:108"><nobr>hot, humid night. Even the roaches must have been sweating—I could barely breathe.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:189924;left:108"><nobr>Just when I thought I'd never go to sleep, I began reciting a couplet, over and over again.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:190509;left:108"><nobr>Two days later, I was taking Mr. Ashok down to Lodi Gardens along with Ms. Uma; he was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:190530;left:108"><nobr>spending more and more time with her these days. The romance was blossoming. My nose was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:190551;left:108"><nobr>getting used to her perfume—I no longer sneezed when she moved.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:190592;left:108"><nobr>&quot;So you <i>still </i>haven't done it, Ashok? Is it going to be like last time all over again?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:190633;left:108"><nobr>&quot;It's not so simple, Uma. Mukesh and I have had a fight over you already. I will put my foot</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:190654;left:108"><nobr>down. But give me some time, I need to get over the divorce—Balram, why have you turned the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:190675;left:108"><nobr>music up so loud?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:190716;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I like it loud. It's romantic. Maybe he's done it deliberately.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:190754;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Look, it'll happen. Trust me. It's just…Balram, why the hell haven't you turned the music down?</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:190778;left:108"><nobr>Sometimes these people from the Darkness are <i>so </i>stupid.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:190820;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I told you that already, Ashok.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:190861;left:108"><nobr>Her voice dropped.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:190902;left:108"><nobr>I caught the words &quot;replacement,&quot; &quot;driver,&quot; and &quot;local&quot; in English.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:190985;left:108"><nobr>He mumbled his reply.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:191027;left:108"><nobr>I could not hear a word. But I did not have to.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:191068;left:108"><nobr>I looked at the rearview mirror: I wanted to confront him, eye to eye, man to man. But he</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:191089;left:108"><nobr>wouldn't look at me in the mirror. Didn't dare face me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:191130;left:108"><nobr>I tell you, you could have heard the grinding of my teeth just then. I thought I was making plans</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:191192;left:108"><nobr>Well, not this time. For every step he'd take, I'd take <i>two.</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:191234;left:108"><nobr>Outside on the road, a streetside vendor was sitting next to a pyramid of motorbike helmets that</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:191886;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Do you want to become prime minister of India?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:191928;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Don't ask me such questions. I have no ambitions for myself. I am simply the voice of the poor</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:192031;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Let me say one last word, if I may. All I have ever wanted was an India where any boy in any</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:192093;left:108"><nobr>According to the radio, the ruling party had been hammered at the polls. A new set of parties had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:192114;left:108"><nobr>come to power. The Great Socialist's party was one of them. He had taken the votes of a big part</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:192135;left:108"><nobr>of the Darkness. As we drove back to Gurgaon, we saw hordes of his supporters pouring in from</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:192155;left:108"><nobr>the Darkness. They drove where they wanted, did what they wanted, whistled at any woman they</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:192218;left:108"><nobr>Mr. Ashok did not call me the rest of the day; in the evening he came down and said he wanted</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:192238;left:108"><nobr>to go to the Imperial Hotel. He was on the cell phone the whole time, punching buttons and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:192259;left:108"><nobr>making calls and screaming:</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:192297;left:108"><nobr>—&quot;We're <i>totally </i>fucked, Uma. This is why I hate this business I'm in. We're at the mercy of</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:192359;left:108"><nobr>—&quot;Don't yell at me, Mukesh. <i>You </i>were the one who said the elections were a foregone</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:193951;left:108"><nobr>&quot;How much?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:193993;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Seven. I was going to settle for five, but the sister-fucker himself offered six—he's a bit soft in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:194014;left:108"><nobr>the head—and then I said seven, and he said okay. I told him if he didn't pay, we'd screw him</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:194034;left:108"><nobr>and his father and his brother and the whole coal-pilfering and tax-evading racket they have. So</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:194055;left:108"><nobr>he began to sweat, and I know he'll pay up.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:194097;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Are you sure? I'd love to send some boys over. I just love to see a rich man roughed up. It's</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:194159;left:108"><nobr>&quot;There will be others. This one isn't worth the trouble. He said he'll bring it on Monday. We're</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:194179;left:108"><nobr>going to do it at the Sheraton. There's a nice restaurant down in the basement. Quiet place.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:194221;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Good. He can buy us dinner as well.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:194262;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Goes without saying. They have lovely kebabs there.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:194304;left:108"><nobr>One of the two men gargled the scotch in his mouth, gulped it in, burped, and sucked his teeth.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:194386;left:108"><nobr>&quot;What?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:194428;left:108"><nobr>&quot;The way we've spread down south. We've got a foothold in Bangalore too. And you know that's</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:194448;left:108"><nobr>where the future is.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:194490;left:108"><nobr>&quot;The south? Bullshit.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:194531;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Why not? One in every three new office buildings in India is being built in Bangalore. It <i>is </i>the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:194594;left:108"><nobr>&quot;<i>Fuck </i>all that. I don't believe a word. The south is full of Tamils. You know who the Tamils are?</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:194614;left:108"><nobr>Negroes. We're the sons of the Aryans who came to India. We made them our slaves. And now</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:194635;left:108"><nobr>they give us lectures. <i>Negroes.</i>&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:194718;left:108"><nobr>I poured them out the rest of the bottle that night.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:194759;left:108"><nobr>At around three in the morning, I drove the City back to the apartment block in Gurgaon. My</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:194780;left:108"><nobr>heart was beating so fast, I didn't want to leave the car at once. I wiped it down and washed it</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:194801;left:108"><nobr>three times over. The bottle was lying on the floor of the car. Johnnie Walker Black—even an</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:194821;left:108"><nobr>empty one is worth money on the black market. I picked it up and went toward the servants'</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:195160;left:108"><nobr>I walked rotating the bottle with my wrist, feeling its weight. Even empty, it wasn't so light.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:195202;left:108"><nobr>I noticed that my feet were slowing down, and the bottle was rotating faster and faster.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:195285;left:108"><nobr>The smashing of the bottle echoed through the hollow of the parking lot—the sound must have</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:195367;left:108"><nobr>I waited for a few minutes, expecting someone to come running down.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:195409;left:108"><nobr>No one. I was safe.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:195450;left:108"><nobr>I held what was left of the bottle up to the light. Long and cruel and clawlike jags.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:195492;left:108"><nobr>Perfect.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:195533;left:108"><nobr>With my foot I gathered the broken pieces of the bottle, which lay all around me, into a pile. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:195554;left:108"><nobr>wiped the blood off my hand, found a broom, and swept the area clean. Then I got down on my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:195574;left:108"><nobr>knees and looked around for any pieces I had failed to pick up; the parking lot echoed with the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:195595;left:108"><nobr>line of a poem that was being recited over and over:</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:195636;left:108"><nobr><i>But the door was always open.</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:195678;left:108"><nobr>Dharam was sleeping on the floor; cockroaches were crawling about his head. I shook him</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:195719;left:108"><nobr>cockroaches. There was still some blood on my palm: three small red drops had formed on my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:195740;left:108"><nobr>flesh, like a row of ladybirds on a leaf. Sucking my palm like a boy, I went to sleep.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:195782;left:108"><nobr>Mr. Ashok did not want me to drive him anywhere on Sunday morning. I washed the dishes in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:195802;left:108"><nobr>the kitchen, wiped the fridge, and said, &quot;I'd like to take the morning off, sir.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:195843;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Why?&quot; he asked, lowering the newspaper. &quot;You've never asked for a whole morning off before.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:195864;left:108"><nobr>Where are you off to?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:195906;left:108"><nobr><i>And you have never before asked me where I was going when I left the house. What has Ms. Uma</i></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:195968;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I want to spend some time with the boy, sir. At the zoo. I thought he would like to see all those</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:196030;left:108"><nobr>He smiled. &quot;You're a good family man, Balram. Go, have fun with the boy.&quot; He went back to</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:196390;left:108"><nobr>the lobby. A small dark man—of the servant class—had come to see him. Mr. Ashok and he</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:196410;left:108"><nobr>talked for a while, and then the small man bowed and left. They looked like two men who had</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:196514;left:108"><nobr>He and I took the bus to the Old Fort, which is where the National Zoo is. I kept my hand on</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:196555;left:108"><nobr>stop my hand from trembling—it had been shaking all morning like a lizard's tail that has fallen</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:196576;left:108"><nobr>off.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:196617;left:108"><nobr>The first strike would be mine. Everything was in place now, nothing could go wrong—but like I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:196638;left:108"><nobr>told you, I am not a brave man.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:196680;left:108"><nobr>The bus was crowded, and the two of us had to stand for the entire journey. We both sweated</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:196700;left:108"><nobr>like pigs. I had forgotten what a bus trip in summer was like. When we stopped at a red light, a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:196721;left:108"><nobr>Mercedes-Benz pulled up alongside the bus. Behind his upraised window, cool in his egg, the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:196742;left:108"><nobr>chauffeur grinned at us, exposing red teeth.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:196783;left:108"><nobr>There was a long line at the ticket counter of the zoo. There were lots of families wanting to go</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:196804;left:108"><nobr>into the zoo, and that I could understand. What puzzled me, though, was the sight of so many</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:196824;left:108"><nobr>young men and women going into the zoo, hand in hand: giggling, pinching each other, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:196845;left:108"><nobr>making eyes, as if the zoo were a romantic place. That made no sense to me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:196887;left:108"><nobr>Now, Mr. Premier, every day thousands of foreigners fly into my country for enlightenment.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:196907;left:108"><nobr>They go to the Himalayas, or to Benaras, or to Bodh Gaya. They get into weird poses of yoga,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:196928;left:108"><nobr>smoke hashish, shag a sadhu or two, and think they're getting enlightened.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:196970;left:108"><nobr>Ha!</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:197011;left:108"><nobr>If it is enlightenment you have come to India for, you people, forget the Ganga—forget the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:197031;left:108"><nobr>ashrams—go straight to the National Zoo in the heart of New Delhi.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:197073;left:108"><nobr>Dharam and I saw the golden-beaked storks sitting on palm trees in the middle of an artificial</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:197094;left:108"><nobr>lake. They swooped down over the green water of the lake, and showed us traces of pink on their</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:197114;left:108"><nobr>wings. In the background, you could see the broken walls of the Old Fort.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:197156;left:108"><nobr>Iqbal, that great poet, was <i>so </i>right. The moment you recognize what is beautiful in this world,</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:197536;left:108"><nobr>We walked for half an hour, from cage to cage. The lion and the lioness were apart from each</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:197557;left:108"><nobr>other and not talking, like a true city couple. The hippo was lying in a giant pond full of mud;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:197578;left:108"><nobr>Dharam wanted to do what others were doing—throw a stone at the hippo to stir it up—but I told</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:197598;left:108"><nobr>him that would be a cruel thing. Hippos lie in mud and do nothing—that's their nature.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:197785;left:108"><nobr>We came to an enclosure with tall bamboo bars, and there—seen in the interstices of the bars, as</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:197805;left:108"><nobr>it paced back and forth in a straight line—was a tiger.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:197847;left:108"><nobr>Not <i>any </i>kind of tiger.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:197888;left:108"><nobr>The creature that gets born only once every generation in the jungle.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:197930;left:108"><nobr>I watched him walk behind the bamboo bars. Black stripes and sunlit white fur flashed through</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:197950;left:108"><nobr>the slits in the dark bamboo; it was like watching the slowed-down reels of an old black-and-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:197971;left:108"><nobr>white film. He was walking in the same line, again and again—from one end of the bamboo bars</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:197992;left:108"><nobr>to the other, then turning around and repeating it over, at exactly the same pace, like a thing</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:198012;left:108"><nobr>under a spell.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:198054;left:108"><nobr>He was hypnotizing himself by walking like this—that was the only way he could tolerate this</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:198075;left:108"><nobr>cage.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:198116;left:108"><nobr>Then the thing behind the bamboo bars stopped moving. It turned its face to my face. The tiger's</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:198137;left:108"><nobr>eyes met my eyes, like my master's eyes have met mine so often in the mirror of the car.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:198178;left:108"><nobr>All at once, the tiger vanished.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:198219;left:108"><nobr>A tingling went from the base of my spine into my groin. My knees began to shake; I felt light.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:198240;left:108"><nobr>Someone near me shrieked. &quot;His eyes are rolling! He's going to faint!&quot; I tried to shout back at</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:198282;left:108"><nobr>The ground beneath me was shaking. Something was digging its way toward me, and then claws</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:198302;left:108"><nobr>tore out of mud and dug into my flesh and pulled me down into the dark earth.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:198766;left:108"><nobr>He wrote it down in his slow, beautiful hand. He told her about the hippos, and the chimpanzees,</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:199035;left:108"><nobr>He wrote it all down for ten minutes, writing so fast that his pen got black and oozy with</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:199325;left:108"><nobr>but not before. Understand?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:199366;left:441"><nobr>* * *</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:199405;left:108"><nobr>It was raining all morning, a light, persistent kind of rain. I heard the rain, though I could not see</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:199426;left:108"><nobr>it. I went to the Honda City, placed the incense stick inside, wiped the seats, wiped the stickers,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:199447;left:108"><nobr>and punched the ogre in the mouth. I threw a bundle near the driver's seat. I shut all the doors</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:199467;left:108"><nobr>and locked them.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:199509;left:108"><nobr>Then, taking two steps back from the Honda City, I bowed low to it with folded palms.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:199550;left:108"><nobr>I went to see what Dharam was doing. He was looking lonely, so I made a paper boat for him,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:199571;left:108"><nobr>and we sailed it in the gutter outside the apartment block.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:199612;left:108"><nobr>After lunch, I called Dharam into my room. </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:199871;left:108"><nobr>I put my hands on his shoulders; slowly I turned him around so he faced away from me. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:199891;left:108"><nobr>dropped a rupee coin on the ground.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:199933;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Bend down and pick that up.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:199974;left:108"><nobr>He did so, and I watched. Dharam combed his hair just like Mr. Ashok did—with a part down</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:199995;left:108"><nobr>the middle; when you stood up over him, there was a clear white line down his scalp, leading up</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200016;left:108"><nobr>to the spot on the crown where the strands of a man's hairline radiate from.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200057;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Stand up straight.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200099;left:108"><nobr>I turned him around a full circle. I dropped the rupee again.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200140;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Pick it up one more time.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200181;left:108"><nobr>I watched the spot.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200223;left:108"><nobr>Telling him to sit in a corner of the room and keep watch over me, I went inside my mosquito</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200244;left:108"><nobr>net, folded my legs, closed my eyes, touched my palms to my knees, and breathed in.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200285;left:108"><nobr>I don't know how long I sat like the Buddha, but it lasted until one of the servants shouted out</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200306;left:108"><nobr>that I was wanted at the front door. I opened my eyes—Dharam was sitting in a corner of the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200326;left:108"><nobr>room, watching me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200368;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Come here,&quot; I said—I gave him a hug, and put ten rupees into his pocket. He'd need that.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200409;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Balram, you're late! The bell is ringing like crazy!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200451;left:108"><nobr>I walked to the car, inserted the key, and turned the engine on. Mr. Ashok was standing at the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200471;left:108"><nobr>entrance with an umbrella and a cell phone. He was talking on the phone as he got into the car</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200492;left:108"><nobr>and slammed the door.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200534;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I still can't believe it. The people of this country had a chance to put an efficient ruling party</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200554;left:108"><nobr>back in power, and instead they have voted in the most outrageous bunch of thugs. We don't</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200575;left:108"><nobr>deserve—&quot; He put the phone aside for a moment and said, &quot;First to the city, Balram—I'll tell you</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200595;left:108"><nobr>where&quot;—and then resumed the phone talk.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200637;left:108"><nobr>The roads were greasy with mud and water. I drove slowly.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200675;left:108"><nobr>&quot;…parliamentary democracy, Father. We will never catch up with China for this single reason.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200720;left:108"><nobr>First stop was in the city—at one of the usual banks. He took the red bag and went in, and I saw</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200741;left:108"><nobr>him inside the glass booth, pressing the buttons of the cash machine. When he came back, I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200761;left:108"><nobr>could feel that the weight of the bag on the backseat had increased. We went from bank to bank,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200782;left:108"><nobr>and the weight of the red bag grew. I felt its pressure increase on my lower back—as if I were</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:200803;left:108"><nobr>taking Mr. Ashok and his bag not in a car, but the way my father would take a customer and his </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:201390;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:201432;left:108"><nobr>I put the CD on. The voice of Sting came on. The car picked up speed. In a little while, we</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:201452;left:108"><nobr>passed the famous bronze statue of Gandhi leading his followers from darkness to the light.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:201494;left:108"><nobr>Now the road emptied. The rain was coming down lightly. If we kept going this way, we would</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:201514;left:108"><nobr>come to the hotel—the grandest of all in the capital of my country, the place where visiting heads</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:201535;left:108"><nobr>of state, like yourself, always stay. But Delhi is a city where civilization can appear and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:201556;left:108"><nobr>disappear within five minutes. On either side of us right now there was just wilderness and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:201576;left:108"><nobr>rubbish.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:201618;left:108"><nobr>In the rearview mirror I saw him paying attention to nothing but his cell phone. A blue glow</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:201639;left:108"><nobr>from the phone lit up his face. Without looking up, he asked me, &quot;What's wrong, Balram? Why</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:201659;left:108"><nobr>has the car stopped?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:201701;left:108"><nobr>I touched the magnetic stickers of the goddess Kali for luck, then opened the glove compartment.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:201722;left:108"><nobr>There it was—the broken bottle, with its claws of glass.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:201763;left:108"><nobr>&quot;There's something off with the wheel, sir. Just give me a couple of minutes.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:201804;left:108"><nobr>Before I could even touch it, I swear, the door of the car opened. I was out in the drizzle.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:201846;left:108"><nobr>There was soggy black mud everywhere. Picking my way over mud and rainwater, I squatted</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:201866;left:108"><nobr>near the left rear wheel, which was hidden from the road by the body of the car. There was a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:201887;left:108"><nobr>large clump of bushes to one side—and a stretch of wasteland beyond.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:201929;left:108"><nobr>You've never seen the road this empty. You'd swear it's been arranged just for you.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:201970;left:108"><nobr>The only light inside the car was the blue glow from his cell phone. I rapped against his glass</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:201991;left:108"><nobr>with a finger. He turned to me without lowering the window. </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:202371;left:108"><nobr>Pressed to the wet glass, my lips made a grin.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:202413;left:108"><nobr>He released the phone. I made a fist and thumped on his glass. He lowered the window with a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:202433;left:108"><nobr>look of displeasure. Sting's soft voice came through the window.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:202599;left:108"><nobr>His body just wouldn't budge! It knew—the body knew—though the mind was too stupid to</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:202661;left:108"><nobr>&quot;The wheel, sir. I'll need your help. It's stuck in the mud.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:202702;left:108"><nobr>Just then headlights flashed on me: a car was coming down the road. My heart skipped a beat.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:202723;left:108"><nobr>But it just drove right past us, splashing muddy water at my feet.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:202764;left:108"><nobr>He put a hand on the door and was about to step out, but some instinct of self-preservation still</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:202785;left:108"><nobr>held him back.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:202827;left:108"><nobr>&quot;It's raining, Balram. Do you think we should call for help?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:202868;left:108"><nobr>He wriggled and moved away from the door.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:202910;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Oh, no, sir. Trust me. Come out.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:202951;left:108"><nobr>He was still wriggling—his body was moving as far from me as it could. <i>I'm losing him, </i>I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:202971;left:108"><nobr>thought, and this forced me to do something I knew I would hate myself for, even years later. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:202992;left:108"><nobr><i>really </i>didn't want to do this—I <i>really </i>didn't want him to think, even in the two or three minutes</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:203075;left:108"><nobr>&quot;It's been giving problems ever since that night we went to the hotel in Jangpura.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:203117;left:108"><nobr>He looked up from the cell phone at once.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:203932;left:108"><nobr>Down below me, his head was just a black ball—and in the blackness, I saw a thin white line of</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:204098;left:108"><nobr>I stood still, like a schoolboy caught out by his teacher. I thought: <i>That landlord's brain of his</i></nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:205244;left:108"><nobr>favorite spot. When I touched this spot, the pit of my father's neck, I controlled him—I could</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:205265;left:108"><nobr>make him stop breathing with the pressure of a finger.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:205306;left:108"><nobr>The Stork's son opened his eyes—just as I pierced his neck—and his lifeblood spurted into my</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:205327;left:108"><nobr>eyes.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:205368;left:108"><nobr>I was blind. I was a free man.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:205410;left:108"><nobr>When I got the blood out of my eyes, it was all over for Mr. Ashok. The blood was draining from</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:205430;left:108"><nobr>the neck quite fast—I believe that is the way the Muslims kill their chickens.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:205472;left:108"><nobr>But then tuberculosis is a worse way to go than this, I assure you.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:205513;left:108"><nobr>After dragging the body into the bushes, I plunged my hands and face into the rainwater and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:205534;left:108"><nobr>muck. I picked up the bundle near my feet—the white cotton T-shirt, the one with lots of white</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:205555;left:108"><nobr>space and just one word in English—and changed into it. Reaching for the gilded box of tissues, </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:206080;left:108"><nobr>If I left him there now, the police would certainly arrest him as an accomplice. They would</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:206163;left:108"><nobr>On the other hand, if I went back now all the way to Gurgaon, someone might discover the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:206225;left:108"><nobr>I squatted on the floor of the station, pressed down by indecision. There was a squealing noise to</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:206266;left:108"><nobr>popped out of the bucket. A little creature, a baby boy. A homeless man and woman, covered in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:206287;left:108"><nobr>filth, sat on either side of the bucket, gazing blankly into the distance. Between his fatigued</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:206308;left:108"><nobr>parents, this little thing was having the time of his life, playing with the water and splashing it on</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:206328;left:108"><nobr>passersby. &quot;Don't do it, little boy,&quot; I said. He splashed more water, squealing with pleasure each</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:206349;left:108"><nobr>time he hit me. I raised my hand. He ducked into his bucket and kept thrashing from the inside.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:206391;left:108"><nobr>I reached into my pockets, searched for a rupee coin, checked to make sure it wasn't a <i>two</i>-rupee</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:207268;left:108"><nobr>Old friend!</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207309;left:108"><nobr>Tonight we bring this glorious tale to a conclusion. As I was doing my yoga this morning—that's</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207330;left:108"><nobr>right, I wake up at eleven in the morning every day and go straight into an hour of yoga—I began</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207351;left:108"><nobr>reflecting on the progress of my story, and realized that I'm almost done. All that remains to be</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207372;left:108"><nobr>told is how I changed from a hunted criminal into a solid pillar of Bangalorean society.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207413;left:108"><nobr>Incidentally, sir, while we're on the topic of yoga—may I just say that an hour of deep breathing,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207434;left:108"><nobr>yoga, and meditation in the morning constitutes the perfect start to the entrepreneur's day. How I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207454;left:108"><nobr>would handle the stresses of this fucking business without yoga, I have no idea. Make yoga a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207475;left:108"><nobr>must in all Chinese schools—that's my suggestion.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207516;left:108"><nobr>But back to the story, now.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207558;left:108"><nobr>First, I want to explain one thing about a fugitive's life. Being a man on the run isn't all about</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207579;left:108"><nobr>fear—a fugitive is entitled to his share of fun too.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207620;left:108"><nobr>That evening as I was sweeping up the pieces of the Johnnie Walker bottle in the parking lot, I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207641;left:108"><nobr>worked out a plan for how I would get to Bangalore. It wouldn't be on a direct train—no.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207662;left:108"><nobr>Someone might see me, and then the police would know where I had gone. Instead, I would</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207682;left:108"><nobr>transfer myself from train to train, zigzagging my way down to Bangalore.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207723;left:108"><nobr>Although my schedule was shot to pieces when I went to get Dharam—he was sleeping in the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207744;left:108"><nobr>net, and I woke him up and said we were going on a holiday to the South, and dragged him out—</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207765;left:108"><nobr>and it was hard to keep my red bag in one hand and Dharam in the other hand (for the train</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207786;left:108"><nobr>station is a dangerous place for a little boy, you know—lots of shady characters around), still I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207806;left:108"><nobr>began to move in this zigzag way south from Delhi.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207848;left:108"><nobr>On the third day of traveling like this, red bag in hand, I was at Hyderabad, waiting in line at the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207869;left:108"><nobr>station tea shop to buy a cup of tea before my train left. (Dharam was guarding the seat in the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207889;left:108"><nobr>compartment.) There was a gecko just above the tea shop, and I was looking at it with concern,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:207910;left:108"><nobr>hoping it would move before it was my turn to get tea. </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:208187;left:108"><nobr>The gecko turned to the left—it ran over a large piece of paper posted on the wall—it stood still</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208207;left:108"><nobr>for a moment, like that, then darted to the side.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208249;left:108"><nobr>That large piece of paper on the wall was a police poster—<i>my </i>police poster. It had already</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:208311;left:108"><nobr>A smile that lasted just a second. For some bizarre reason—you'll see how sloppily things get</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208332;left:108"><nobr>done in India—my poster had been stapled to another poster, of two guys from Kashmir—two</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208353;left:108"><nobr>terrorists wanted for bombing something or the other.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208394;left:108"><nobr>You'd almost think, looking at the posters, that I was a terrorist too. How annoying.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208435;left:108"><nobr>I realized that I was being watched. A fellow with his hands behind his back was looking at the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208456;left:108"><nobr>poster, and at me, most intently. I began to tremble. I edged away from the poster, but I was too</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208477;left:108"><nobr>late. The moment he saw me leaving, he ran up to me, caught my wrist, and stared at my face.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208518;left:108"><nobr>Then he said, &quot;What's it say? That poster you're reading?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208560;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Read it for yourself.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208601;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Can't.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208642;left:108"><nobr>Now I understood why he had come running. It was the desperation of an illiterate man to get the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208663;left:108"><nobr>attention of the literate man. From his accent I knew he was from the Darkness too.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208704;left:108"><nobr>&quot;It's the wanted-men list for this week,&quot; I said. &quot;Those two are terrorists. From Kashmir.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208746;left:108"><nobr>&quot;What did they do?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208787;left:108"><nobr>&quot;They blew up a school. They killed eight children.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208829;left:108"><nobr>&quot;And this fellow? The one with the mustache?&quot; He tapped my photo with a knuckle of his right</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208850;left:108"><nobr>hand.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208891;left:108"><nobr>&quot;He's the guy who caught them.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208932;left:108"><nobr>&quot;How did he do that?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208974;left:108"><nobr>To create the illusion I was reading the printing on the wall, I squinted at the two posters, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:208994;left:108"><nobr>moved my lips.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:209036;left:108"><nobr>&quot;This fellow was a driver. Says here he was in his car, and these two terrorist guys came up to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:209057;left:108"><nobr>him.&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:209851;left:108"><nobr>I looked at his face, and I looked at the photo.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:209892;left:108"><nobr>&quot;It's true,&quot; I said, slapping him on the back.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:209996;left:108"><nobr>must have endured at so many railway stations—being mocked and hoodwinked by strangers—I</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:210242;left:108"><nobr>morning at eight and walked around with a bag full of cash in my hands for four hours (I dared</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:210263;left:108"><nobr>not leave it in the hotel room) before returning for lunch.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:210304;left:108"><nobr>Dharam and I ate together. What he did to keep himself amused in the mornings I don't know,</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:210708;left:108"><nobr>I was eager to try coffee. You see, poor people in the north of this country drink tea, and poor</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:210853;left:108"><nobr>watched.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:210894;left:108"><nobr>It took me a week to realize that everyone was doing it differently. One man poured all the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:210915;left:108"><nobr>coffee into his tumbler at once; another never used the tumbler at all.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:210956;left:108"><nobr><i>They're all strangers here, </i>I said to myself. <i>They're all drinking coffee for the first time.</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:210998;left:108"><nobr>That was another of the attractions of Bangalore. The city was full of outsiders. No one would</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:211018;left:108"><nobr>notice one more.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:211060;left:108"><nobr>I spent four weeks in that hotel near the railway station, doing nothing. I admit there were doubts</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:211080;left:108"><nobr>in my mind. Should I have gone to Mumbai instead? But the police would have thought of that at</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:211101;left:108"><nobr>once—everyone goes to Mumbai in the films after they kill someone, don't they?</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:211143;left:108"><nobr>Calcutta! I should have gone <i>there.</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:211184;left:108"><nobr>One morning Dharam said: &quot;Uncle, you look so depressed. Let's go for a walk.&quot; We walked</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:211205;left:108"><nobr>through a park where drunken men lay on benches amid wild overgrown weeds. We came out</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:211226;left:108"><nobr>onto a broad road; on the other side of the road stood a huge stone building with a golden lion on</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:211246;left:108"><nobr>top of it.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:211287;left:108"><nobr>&quot;What is this building, Uncle?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:211329;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I don't know, Dharam. It must be where the ministers live in Bangalore.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:211370;left:108"><nobr>On the gable of the building I saw a slogan:</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:211412;left:108"><nobr>GOVERNMENT WORK IS GOD'S WORK</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:211453;left:108"><nobr>&quot;You're smiling, Uncle.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:211495;left:108"><nobr>&quot;You're right, Dharam. I <i>am </i>smiling. I think we'll have a good time in Bangalore,&quot; I said and I </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:211792;left:108"><nobr>I moved out of the hotel and took a flat on rent. Now I had to make a living in Bangalore—I had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:211813;left:108"><nobr>to find out how I could fit into this city.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:211854;left:108"><nobr>I tried to hear Bangalore's voice, just as I had heard Delhi's.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:211896;left:108"><nobr>I went down M.G. Road and sat down at the Café Coffee Day, the one with the outdoor tables. I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:211917;left:108"><nobr>had a pen and a piece of paper with me, and I wrote down everything I overheard.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:211958;left:108"><nobr><i>I completed that computer program in two and a half minutes.</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:211999;left:108"><nobr><i>An American today offered me four-hundred thousand dollars for my start-up and I told him,</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:212020;left:108"><nobr><i>&quot;That's not enough!&quot;</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:212061;left:108"><nobr><i>Is Hewlett-Packard a better company than IBM?</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:212103;left:108"><nobr>Everything in the city, it seemed, came down to one thing.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:212144;left:108"><nobr>Outsourcing. Which meant doing things in India for Americans over the phone. Everything</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:212165;left:108"><nobr>flowed from it—real estate, wealth, power, sex. So I would have to join this outsourcing thing,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:212186;left:108"><nobr>one way or the other.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:212227;left:108"><nobr>The next day I took an autorickshaw up to Electronics City. I found a banyan tree by the side of a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:212248;left:108"><nobr>road, and I sat down under it. I sat and watched the buildings until it was evening and I saw all</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:212268;left:108"><nobr>the SUVs racing in; and then I watched until two in the morning, when the SUVs began racing</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:212289;left:108"><nobr>out of the buildings.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:212331;left:108"><nobr>And I thought, <i>That's it. That's how I fit in.</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:212372;left:108"><nobr>Let me explain, Your Excellency. See, men and women in Bangalore live like the animals in a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:212393;left:108"><nobr>forest do. Sleep in the day and then work all night, until two, three, four, five o'clock, depending,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:212414;left:108"><nobr>because their masters are on the other side of the world, in America. Big question: how will the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:212434;left:108"><nobr>boys and girls—girls especially—get from home to the workplace in the late evening and then</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:212455;left:108"><nobr>get back home at three in the morning? There is no night bus system in Bangalore, no train</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:212475;left:108"><nobr>system like in Mumbai. The girls would not be safe on buses or trains anyway. The men of this</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:212496;left:108"><nobr>city, frankly speaking, are animals.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:212538;left:108"><nobr>That's where entrepreneurs come in.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:212579;left:108"><nobr>The next thing I did was to go to a Toyota Qualis dealer in the city and say, in my sweetest</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:212600;left:108"><nobr>voice, &quot;I want to drive your cars.&quot; The dealer looked at me, puzzled.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:212641;left:108"><nobr>I couldn't believe I had said that. Once a servant, always a servant: the instinct is always there,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:212662;left:108"><nobr>inside you, somewhere near the base of your spine. If you ever came to my office, Mr. Premier, I</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:212683;left:108"><nobr>would probably try to press your feet at once. </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:212959;left:108"><nobr>I pinched my left palm. I smiled as I held it pinched and said—in a deep, gruff voice, &quot;I want to</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:213061;left:108"><nobr>The last stage in my amazing success story, sir, was to go from being a social entrepreneur to a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213082;left:108"><nobr>business entrepreneur. This part wasn't easy at all.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213123;left:108"><nobr>I called them all up, one after the other, the officers of all the outsourcing companies in</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213143;left:108"><nobr>Bangalore. Did they need a taxi service to pick up their employees in the evening? Did they need</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213164;left:108"><nobr>a taxi service to drop off their employees late at night?</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213206;left:108"><nobr>And you know what they all said, of course.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213247;left:108"><nobr>One woman was kind enough to explain:</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213289;left:108"><nobr>&quot;You're too late. Every business in Bangalore already has a taxi service to pick up and drop off</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213309;left:108"><nobr>their employees at night. I'm sorry to tell you this.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213351;left:108"><nobr>It was just like starting out in Dhanbad—I got depressed. I lay in bed a whole day.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213392;left:108"><nobr><i>What would Mr. Ashok do? </i>I wondered.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213433;left:108"><nobr>Then it hit me. I wasn't alone—I had someone on my side! I had thousands on my side!</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213475;left:108"><nobr>You'll see my friends when you visit Bangalore—fat, paunchy men swinging their canes, on</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213496;left:108"><nobr>Brigade Road, poking and harassing vendors and shaking them down for money.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213537;left:108"><nobr>I'm talking of the police, of course.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213578;left:108"><nobr>The next day I paid a local to be a translator—you know, I'm sure, that the people of the north</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213599;left:108"><nobr>and the south in my country speak different languages—and went to the nearest police station. In</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213620;left:108"><nobr>my hand I had the red bag. I acted like an important man, and made sure the policemen saw the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213640;left:108"><nobr>red bag by swinging it a lot, and gave them a business card I had just had printed. Then I insisted</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213661;left:108"><nobr>on seeing the big man there, the inspector. At last they let me into his office—the red bag had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213682;left:108"><nobr>done the trick.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213723;left:108"><nobr>The big man sat at a huge desk, with shiny badges on his khaki uniform and the red marks of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213744;left:108"><nobr>religion on his forehead. Behind him were three portraits of gods. But not the one I was looking</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213765;left:108"><nobr>for.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213806;left:108"><nobr>Oh, thank God. There was one of Gandhi too. It was in the corner.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213847;left:108"><nobr>With a big smile—and a <i>namaste</i>—I handed him the red bag. He opened it cautiously.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:213889;left:108"><nobr>I said, via the translator, &quot;Sir, I want to make a small offering of my gratitude to you.&quot; </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:214272;left:108"><nobr>He counted the money—ten thousand rupees—heard what I wanted, and asked for double. I gave</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:214417;left:108"><nobr>most of the drivers did not have licenses.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:214458;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I'm so sorry, madam,&quot; I said. &quot;I offer you my sympathies. In addition, I offer you my company.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:214562;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Of course, madam. You can call the police and check.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:214603;left:108"><nobr>She did just that, and called me back. I think the police must have put in a good word for me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:214624;left:108"><nobr>And that was how I got my own—as they say in English—&quot;start-up.&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:216039;left:108"><nobr>rumors, threats of insurrection. Men sit under lampposts at night and read. Men huddle together</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:216060;left:108"><nobr>and discuss and point fingers to the heavens. One night, will they all join together—will they</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:216876;left:108"><nobr>sickens me now. I don't think it's healthy for a woman to have that color of hair. I don't trust the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:216938;left:108"><nobr>go to &quot;red light districts&quot; anymore. It's not right to buy and sell women who live in birdcages and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:216958;left:108"><nobr>get treated like animals. I only buy girls I find in five-star hotels.)</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:217124;left:108"><nobr>In fact, the sight of these golden-haired foreigners—and you'll discover that Bangalore is full of</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:217145;left:108"><nobr>them these days—has only convinced me that the white people are on the way out. All of them</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:217166;left:108"><nobr>look so emaciated—so puny. You'll never see one of them with a decent belly. For this I blame</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:217186;left:108"><nobr>the president of America; he has made buggery perfectly legal in his country, and men are</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:217207;left:108"><nobr>marrying other men instead of women. This was on the radio. This is leading to the decline of the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:217227;left:108"><nobr>white man. Then white people use cell phones too much, and that is destroying their brains. It's a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:217248;left:108"><nobr>known fact. Cell phones cause cancer in the brain and shrink your masculinity; the Japanese</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:217269;left:108"><nobr>invented them to diminish the white man's brain and balls at the same time. I overheard this at</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:217290;left:108"><nobr>the bus stand one night. Until then I had been very proud of my Nokia, showing it to all the call-</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:217310;left:108"><nobr>center girls I was hoping to dip my beak into, but I threw it away at once. Every call that you</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:217331;left:108"><nobr>make to me, you have to make it on a landline. It hurts my business, but my brain is too</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:217352;left:108"><nobr>important, sir: it's all that a thinking man has in this world.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:217393;left:108"><nobr>White men will be finished within my lifetime. There are blacks and reds too, but I have no idea</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:217414;left:108"><nobr>what they're up to—the radio never talks about them. My humble prediction: in twenty years'</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:217978;left:108"><nobr>See, that night, I was sitting here, telling you my life's story, when my landline began to ring.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:217999;left:108"><nobr>Still chatting to you, I picked up the receiver and heard Mohammad Asif's voice.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:218041;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Sir, there's been some trouble.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:218082;left:108"><nobr>That's when I stopped talking to you.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:218123;left:108"><nobr>&quot;What kind of trouble?&quot; I asked. I knew Mohammad Asif had been on duty that night, so I</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:218185;left:108"><nobr>There was a silence, and then he said, &quot;I was taking the girls home when we hit a boy on a</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:218372;left:108"><nobr>The police were there when I got to the scene with an empty van. The Qualis was parked by the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:218434;left:108"><nobr>There was a body, a boy, lying on the ground, bloodied. The bike was on the ground, smashed</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:218455;left:108"><nobr>and twisted.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:218496;left:108"><nobr>Mohammad Asif was standing off to the side, shaking his head. Someone was yelling at him—</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:218517;left:108"><nobr>yelling with the passion that you only see on the face of the relative of a dead man.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:218558;left:108"><nobr>The policeman on the scene had stalled everyone. He nodded when he saw me. We knew each</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:218620;left:108"><nobr>&quot;That's the dead boy's brother, sir,&quot; he whispered to me. &quot;He's in a total rage. I haven't been able</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:219045;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Look here, son,&quot; I said, &quot;I am the owner of this vehicle. Your fight is with me, not with this</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:219148;left:108"><nobr>The policeman played along with me. &quot;It's a good idea, son. We need to register the case at the</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:219231;left:108"><nobr>and all the girls got into my van and slipped away. That was the first objective—to get the girls</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:219252;left:108"><nobr>home. I have signed a contract with their company, and I honor all that I sign.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:219293;left:108"><nobr>I went to the police station with the dead boy's brother. The policemen on night duty brought me</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:219314;left:108"><nobr>coffee. They did not bring the boy coffee. He glared at me as I took the cup; he looked ready to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:219334;left:108"><nobr>tear me to pieces. I sipped.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:219376;left:108"><nobr>&quot;The assistant commissioner will be here in five minutes,&quot; one of the policemen said.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:219417;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Is he the one who's going to register the case?&quot; the brother asked. &quot;Because no one has done it</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:219479;left:108"><nobr>I sipped some more.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:219521;left:108"><nobr>The assistant commissioner who sat in the station was a man whom I had lubricated often. He</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:219542;left:108"><nobr>had fixed a rival for me once. He was the worst kind of man, who had nothing in his mind but</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:219562;left:108"><nobr>taking money from everyone who came to his office. Scum.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:219603;left:108"><nobr>But he was <i>my </i>scum.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:219645;left:108"><nobr>My heart lifted at the sight of him. He had come all the way to the station at night to help me out.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:219666;left:108"><nobr>There is honesty among thieves, as they say. He understood the situation immediately. Ignoring</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:219686;left:108"><nobr>me, he went up to the brother and said, &quot;What is it you want?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:219728;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I want to file an F.I.R.,&quot; the brother said. &quot;I want this crime recorded.&quot;</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:221710;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Don't worry about it, Asif,&quot; I said. The boy looked so devastated.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:221752;left:108"><nobr>I've come to respect Muslims, sir. They're not the brightest lot, except for those four poet</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:221793;left:108"><nobr>them seem to get this urge to blow trains up every year. I wasn't going to fire Asif over this.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:221835;left:108"><nobr>But I did ask him to find out the address of the boy, the one we had killed.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:221876;left:108"><nobr>He stared at me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:221918;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Why go, sir? We don't have to fear anything from the parents. Please don't do this.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:221959;left:108"><nobr>I made him find the address and I made him give it to me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:222000;left:108"><nobr>I took cash out of my locker in crisp new one-hundred-rupee notes; I put them in a brown</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:222062;left:108"><nobr>The mother was the one who opened the door. She asked me what I wanted, and I said, &quot;I am the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:222083;left:108"><nobr>owner of the taxi company.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:222125;left:108"><nobr>I didn't have to tell her which one.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:222166;left:108"><nobr>She brought me a cup of coffee in a cup set in a metal tumbler. They have exquisite manners,</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:222505;left:108"><nobr>There was a photo of a young man, with a large jasmine garland around it, up on the wall.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:222588;left:108"><nobr>An old man had come into the room now, and he stood staring at me.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:222629;left:108"><nobr>&quot;First of all, I want to express my deep sorrow at the death of your son. Having lost relatives</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:222650;left:108"><nobr>myself—so many of them—I know the pain that you have suffered. He should not have died.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:222691;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Second, the fault is mine. Not the driver's. The police have let me off. That is the way of this</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:222753;left:108"><nobr>I pointed to the brown envelope lying on the table.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:222795;left:108"><nobr>&quot;There are twenty-five thousand rupees in here. I don't give it to you because I have to, but</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:222816;left:108"><nobr>because I want to. Do you understand?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:222857;left:108"><nobr>The old woman would not take the money.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:222898;left:108"><nobr>But the old man, the father, was eyeing the envelope. &quot;At least you were man enough to come,&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:222919;left:108"><nobr>he said.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:222960;left:108"><nobr>&quot;I want to help your other son,&quot; I said. &quot;He is a brave boy. He stood up to the police the other</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:223023;left:108"><nobr>The woman clenched her face and shook her head. Tears poured out of her eyes. It was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:223043;left:108"><nobr>understandable. She might have had the hopes for that boy that my mother had for me. But the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:223064;left:108"><nobr>father was amenable; men are more reasonable in such matters.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:223106;left:108"><nobr>I thanked him for the coffee, bowed respectfully before the bereaved mother, and left.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:223147;left:108"><nobr>Mohammad Asif was waiting for me at the office when I got back. He shook his head and said,</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:223167;left:108"><nobr>&quot;Why? Why did you waste so much money?&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:223209;left:108"><nobr>That's when I thought, <i>Maybe I've made a mistake</i>. Maybe Asif will tell the other drivers I was</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:223230;left:108"><nobr>frightened of the old woman, and they will think they can cheat me. It makes me nervous. I don't</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:223250;left:108"><nobr>like showing weakness in front of my employees. I know what that leads to.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:224042;left:108"><nobr>About three months after I came to Bangalore, I went to a temple and performed last rites there</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:224063;left:108"><nobr>for all of them: Kusum, Kishan, and all my aunts, cousins, nephews, and nieces. I even said a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:224084;left:108"><nobr>prayer for the water buffalo. Who knows who has lived and who has not? And then I said to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:224104;left:108"><nobr>Kishan, and to Kusum, and to all of them: &quot;Now leave me in peace.&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:224146;left:108"><nobr>And they have, sir, by and large.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:224187;left:108"><nobr>One day I read a story in a newspaper: &quot;Family of 17 Murdered in North Indian Village.&quot; My</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:224208;left:108"><nobr>heart began to thump—seventeen? That can't be right—that's not mine. It was just one of those</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:224229;left:108"><nobr>two-inch horror stories that appear every morning in the papers—they didn't give a name to the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:224249;left:108"><nobr>village. They just said it was somewhere in the Darkness—near Gaya. I read it again and again—</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:224266;left:108"><nobr>seventeen! There aren't seventeen at home…I breathed out…But what if someone's had</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:224287;left:108"><nobr>children…?</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:224332;left:108"><nobr>I crumpled that paper and threw it away. I stopped reading the newspaper for a few months after</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:224353;left:108"><nobr>that. Just to be safe.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:224394;left:108"><nobr>Look, here's what would have happened to them. Either the Stork had them killed, or had some</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:224415;left:108"><nobr>of them killed, and the others beaten. Now, even if by some miracle he—or the police—didn't do</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:224436;left:108"><nobr>that, the neighbors would have shunned them. See, a bad boy in one family casts the village's</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:224456;left:108"><nobr>reputation into the dust. So the villagers would have forced them out—and they'd have to go to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:224477;left:108"><nobr>Delhi, or Calcutta, or Mumbai, to live under some concrete bridge, begging for their food, and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:224498;left:108"><nobr>without a hope for the future. That's not much better than being dead.</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:227298;left:108"><nobr>Ganga? True, there was the matter of murder—which is a wrong thing to do, no question about</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227319;left:108"><nobr>it. It has darkened my soul. All the skin-whitening creams sold in the markets of India won't</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227340;left:108"><nobr>clean my hands again.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227381;left:108"><nobr>But isn't it likely that everyone who counts in this world, including our prime minister (including</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227402;left:108"><nobr><i>you</i>, Mr. Jiabao), has killed someone or other on their way to the top? Kill enough people and</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227423;left:108"><nobr>they will put up bronze statues to you near Parliament House in Delhi—but that is glory, and not</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227443;left:108"><nobr>what I am after. All I wanted was the chance to be a man—and for that, one murder was enough.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227485;left:108"><nobr>What comes next for me? I <i>know </i>that's what you're wondering.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227526;left:108"><nobr>Let me put it this way. This afternoon, driving down M.G. Road, which is our posh shopping</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227547;left:108"><nobr>road with lots of American shops and technology companies, I saw the Yahoo! people putting up</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227568;left:108"><nobr>a new sign outside their office:</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227609;left:108"><nobr><b>HOW BIG CAN YOU THINK?</b></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227650;left:108"><nobr>I took my hands off the wheel and held them wider than an elephant's cock.</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227692;left:108"><nobr>&quot;<i>That </i>big, sister-fucker!&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227733;left:108"><nobr>I love my start-up—this chandelier, and this silver laptop, and these twenty-six Toyota</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227754;left:108"><nobr>Qualises—but honestly, I'll get bored of it sooner or later. I'm a <i>first-gear </i>man, Mr. Premier. In</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227775;left:108"><nobr>the end, I'll have to sell this start-up to some other moron—<i>entrepreneur, </i>I mean—and head into</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227795;left:108"><nobr>a new line. I'm thinking of real estate next. You see, I'm always a man who sees &quot;tomorrow&quot;</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227816;left:108"><nobr>when others see &quot;today.&quot; The whole world will come to Bangalore tomorrow. Just drive to the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227837;left:108"><nobr>airport and count the half-built glass-and-steel boxes as you pass them. Look at the names of the</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227858;left:108"><nobr>American companies that are building them. And when all these Americans come here, where do</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227878;left:108"><nobr>you think they're all going to sleep? On the road?</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227919;left:108"><nobr>Ha!</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227961;left:108"><nobr>Anywhere there's an empty apartment, I take a look at it, I wonder, <i>How much can I get from an</i></nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:227982;left:108"><nobr><i>American for this in 2010? </i>If the place has a future as the home of an American, I put a down</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:228065;left:108"><nobr>After three or four years in real estate, I think I might sell everything, take the money, and start a</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:228085;left:108"><nobr>school—an English-language school—for poor children in Bangalore. A school where you won't</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:228106;left:108"><nobr>be allowed to corrupt anyone's head with prayers and stories about God or Gandhi—nothing but</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:228127;left:108"><nobr>the facts of life for these kids. A school full of White Tigers, unleashed on Bangalore! We'd have </nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:228507;left:108"><nobr>See, sometimes I think I will never get caught. I think the Rooster Coop needs people like me to</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:228528;left:108"><nobr>break out of it. It needs masters like Mr. Ashok—who, for all his numerous virtues, was not</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:228549;left:108"><nobr>much of a master—to be weeded out, and exceptional servants like me to replace them. At such</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:228569;left:108"><nobr>times, I gloat that Mr. Ashok's family can put up a reward of a million dollars on my head, and it</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:228590;left:108"><nobr>will not matter. I have switched sides: I am now one of those who cannot be caught in India. At</nobr></div>
<div style="position:absolute;top:228611;left:108"><nobr>such moments, I look up at this chandelier, and I just want to throw my hands up and holler, so</nobr></div>

<div style="position:absolute;top:228797;left:108"><nobr>Getting caught—it's always a possibility. There's no end to things in India, as Mr. Ashok used to</nobr></div>
